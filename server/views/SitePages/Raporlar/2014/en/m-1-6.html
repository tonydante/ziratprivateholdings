	<strong>Hüseyin AYDIN</strong><br />	
	CEO</h2>

<h2 style="height:220px;">The results that we have achieved in terms of customer and market-focus show that we are making sound progress consistent with our goals and that our customers are demonstrating an ever-greater preference for the Ziraat brand.</h2>

<h6>G4-1, G4-2</h6>

<h2>
Esteemed stakeholders,<br /><br />
We take pleasure in presenting you with this sustainability report, which we have prepared in full compliance with the “comprehensive option” of the new G4 global reporting standard.<br /><br />
<span class="kirmizi">Our sector, sustainability, and Ziraat Bank</span><br />
We believe that the financial services industry, of which Ziraat Bank is a member and inherently a leading player in our country, is charged with a number of critical and essential duties related to the sustainability of a healthy and properly functioning economy, of a strong social structure, and of a livable environment.<br /><br />
Because we are more than just a bank, it is both our obligation and our responsibility to contribute to the long-term wellbeing of society and to provide all-out support for the Turkish economy’s developmental processes by effectively deploying our scale, our knowledge and experience, and our reach.</h2>


<h2 class="sag cizgi">We have identified a set of sustainability priorities that we believe will affect Ziraat Bank’s success in the future as much as it does today as a result of a comprehensive study that takes into account the views of both our internal and external stakeholders.</h2>


<p>We have a  broad and diversified customer base ranging from farmers who make a living in  our country&rsquo;s towns and villages and whose agricultural endeavors create value  for all of us to corporate customers whose exports contribute to the national  economy, from the SMEs that are the backbone of our economy to people engaged  in every sort of occupation. The products, services, and solutions that we  provide to this huge group ourselves and through the subsidiaries that make up  the Ziraat Finance  Group shape the future of our country as  much as they do its present while our strategic decisions and actions  contribute as much to the  efficient functioning of markets as they do to economic stability.</p>
<h1>Our sustainability  priorities</h1>
<p>One of the  fundamental innovations that we have achieved under the heading of our  sustainability-related efforts is that, as a result of a  comprehensive study that takes into account the views of both our internal and  external stakeholders, we have identified a set of sustainability  priorities that we believe will affect Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  success in the future as much as  it does today. </h1>
<p>On the basis  of our prioritization findings, details of which are presented in the  appropriate sections of this report, market- and customer-focus rank foremost  among the issues that are of key importance to Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s performance. This result,  which is the shared opinion of our stakeholders, coincides with the fundamental  objective of the strategic transformation program that our Bank has been  conducting for the last three years. That is because, given the competitive  conditions that prevail nowadays, a service provider&rsquo;s sustainable future and  strong performance are possible if and only if there also exists a strategy  which puts one&rsquo;s customer at the focal point of everything and which seeks to  maximize the value that one proposes to offer.</p>
<p>In addition to market- and customer-focus, our prioritization study also revealed that our rich array of banking products and services, our extensive geographical reach and degree of customer access, and our diversified deposit base also rank high among the reasons why customers prefer Ziraat Bank. Other issues cited by our stakeholders as being as crucial to Ziraat Bank’s future performance as to that of the present are: specific support for agriculture as embodied in Ziraat Bank’s mission, provision of services to the SMEs and entrepreneurs who are so important to the national economy, safeguarding customer data, and effective corporate governance and risk management in a manner that also embraces sustainability management.</p>
<p>The priorities that emerged from this study are important not just for our Bank but for all of the members of the Ziraat Finance Group as well. These findings will serve as our guide when shaping our roadmap and strategies in the period ahead and will also play a significant role in further strengthening our ability to create added value.</p>
<h1>What we promised to do and what we did</h1>
<p>This year Ziraat Bank once again concentrated on  integrating its sustainability approach into all aspects of its banking  business. As a result of the efforts made in line with this, Ziraat Bank further developed its  banking products and services, introduced innovative new products to the  market, streamlined its service processes and made them more efficient,  and–most important of all–came up with new solutions that addressed its  customers&rsquo; needs. While
continuing to develop our organizational structure in response to
current needs and expand our service network, our primary focus
was on making additional improvements in our customers’ service
experience.</p>
<p>What individuals and companies alike demand is banking-market products that are easily accessible, understandable, comparable, and consumer-friendly. For this reason, Ziraat Bank engages in an ongoing effort to satisfy that demand for every customer segment in every business line in which it is active.</p>
<p>Similarly  the new internet banking modules which we recently brought online and which we  are continuing to develop have been received with high levels of customer  appreciation and satisfaction. Each and every product, service, and process  that we digitize by integrating technology into every aspect of our business  processes achieves tremendously important gains for us in terms of improving  our resource efficiency, environmental performance, and overall productivity.  Besides enabling us to make the best and most productive use of our resources,  this approach also leads to substantial savings in our costs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we  launched our &ldquo;Banking Without Barriers&rdquo; project, whose aim is to give our  customers with disabilities a better and more comfortable banking experience  and which we believe to be extremely important in terms of its social benefits.  We are focusing our attentions on giving such customers more convenient access  to our banking products and services through such means as physical changes at  our service venues, call buttons, Braille-equipped information panels,  specially-designed ATM units, and an online branch that can be used by the  visually impaired.</p>
<p>In 2014 we  completed worthy projects aimed at managing not just our carbon footprint but  our entire ecological footprint in the best and most efficient way possible  while also achieving significant savings in the process. One of the most  important inputs that a bank uses is paper. The digitalization projects that we  have been conducting over the last few years have led to extremely important  gains and enabled us to achieve substantial savings in paper consumption. Similarly  and as a result of changes that have been made, we have achieved notable  improvements in water, electricity, and natural gas consumption in the conduct  of our headquarters services operations.</p>
<p>All of the  activities which I have summarized here we see as being important progress  towards the fulfillment of our sustainability goals and we therefore regard  2014 as a year in which we advanced surefootedly in the direction of making Ziraat Bank a more customer-focused  bank.</p>
<p>Thus it  gives me pleasure to say that the progress we achieved throughout 2015,  demonstrates our commitment to fulfilling our promise to be &ldquo;Turkey&rsquo;s oldest  new bank&rdquo;. The results that we have achieved– particularly in terms of  customer- and market-focus–show that we are making sound progress consistent  with our goals and that our customers, who make up our core stakeholder group,  are demonstrating an ever-greater preference for the Ziraat brand.</p>


<h1>The Ziraat Change and  Transformation Project in 2014: &ldquo;Moving Forward Together&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Recognizing  that change is a never-ending journey and aware of the need to constantly renew  itself and adapt to today&rsquo;s tough competitive environment. Ziraat Bank continued to advance  together with its stakeholders in 2014.</p>
<p>The Change  and Transformation Project that Ziraat Bank launched in 2012 reached a new stage in 2014 that may be  summed up by its &ldquo;Moving Forward Together&rdquo; watchword. The efforts to implement  the infrastructural change and corporate transformation components of that  project will continue in the future as well.</p>
<p>The goal of the Ziraat Change and Transformation Project is
to shepherd the Ziraat Finance Group’s essential Corporate
Banking, Branch Banking, and International Banking operations
into the future and finalize the group’s global transformation.
Under this project, our Bank’s sustainability priorities are rooted
in the principles of sound customer relationship management,
institutionalized business processes, operational excellence,
objective and transparent human resources management, effective
information technology, and of course a strong balance sheet.
That being so, efforts were made in line with the Annual Strategic
Roadmap, which was laid out to guide the bank towards its
strategic goals and which is overseen by the Strategic Steering
Committee, and enduring value was created as a result.</p>
<p>With respect to integrating globally-accepted sustainability
principles into our business processes, we will be continuing to add
environmental and social risk-management criteria to our lending
processes and to undertake new projects in order to incorporate a
wider range of dimensions into our structural development.</p>


<h2 class="sag cizgi">The goal of the Ziraat Change and Transformation Project is to shepherd the Ziraat Finance Group’s essential Corporate Banking, Branch Banking, and International Banking operations into the future and finalize the group’s global transformation.</h2>

<h1>Risks and opportunities</h1>
<p>Having been a leading and trend-setting industry actor for a
hundred and fifty-two years, Ziraat Bank intends to remain
one in the future as well. Our Bank calls upon the strengths of
its extensive service network, professional management team,
strong corporate governance, in-depth market acumen, unrivalled
knowledge and experience, and-most important of all-rock-solid
brand as it continues to shape the future.</p>
<p>Both the banking industry as a whole and the other domains of
financial services in which the subsidiaries that make up the Ziraat
Finance Group are active in particular necessarily interact with the
swiftly changing and evolving demands of the global and national
economies.</p>
<p>The rapid developments to which we are witness today clearly
point to the birth of a new global economic balance. That process
will continue to affect not just our country but our business as well.
At the same time, we regard all of the top issues on the world’s
sustainability agenda-but especially the impairment and misuse
of natural resources together with climate change and global
warming-as both risks and opportunities for both Ziraat Bank and
its stakeholders alike.</p>
<h1>On the future</h1>
<p>Today we  stand more ready than ever to work with our stakeholders in order to properly  manage our risks and business opportunities and to make use of both in order to  power our performance. We regard 2015 and the years that follow as a crucially  important period in which our potential will impact on our performance. We  intend to continue engaging in a multidimensional effort in line with our  sustainability priorities and to generate increasingly more synergies  throughout the Ziraat Finance  Group. In this way, we will also be creating increasingly more value that we  can share with our stakeholders and with our country as a whole.</p>
<p>In closing  and speaking both personally and on behalf of the Ziraat Bank Board of Directors, I want  to thank our employees for the efforts that are the enduring source of our  performance, our customers for preferring to do business with us, and our other  stakeholders for their confidence in the Ziraat name.</p>
<p>Very truly  yours,</p>
