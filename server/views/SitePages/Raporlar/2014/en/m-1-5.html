	<strong>Muharrem KARSLI</strong><br />
	Chairman of the Board of Directors
</h2>

<h2 style="height:220px;">In Ziraat Bank’s view, sustainability means ensuring the viability of an ecosystem that will allow all of its stakeholders to completely satisfy all of their needs not just today but equally so in the future as well.</h2>

<h6>G4-1, G4-2, G4-EC2</h6>

<h2>Esteemed stakeholders,</h2>
<h2>The years 2013 and 2014 mark a watershed for Ziraat Bank from the standpoint of internalizing sustainability and authoring exemplary projects to achieve it. The publication of a sustainability report for the first time, the quantification and public disclosure of our carbon footprint, the increasingly greater adoption of a sustainability-mindful approach in our service processes, and environmental protection-focused and social responsibility projects undertaken by our various units are all among the milestones passed during these years.</h2>
<h2>Within this period, Ziraat Bank formulated a Sustainability Policy and, with that policy’s approval and publication by the Board of Directors introduced yet another Ziraat Bank best practice to the Turkish banking industry.</h2>

<h2 class="sag cizgi">We regard our customers, our human resources, strength to produce long-term performance, our strong  balance sheet, and our corporate governance structure as the cornerstones of our approach to sustainability.</h2>


<h1>Another important innovation that is in keeping with our goal of constant  improvement in our sustainability journey is our transition to the G4 standard  in this year&rsquo;s report.</h1>
<p>As our stakeholders may  recall, Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s  first sustainability report was prepared according to the G3.1 standard and it  was certified as being fully compliant with GRI&rsquo;s A+ level reporting  parameters. Our 2014 report was prepared to be compatible and fully compliant  with new-generation global reporting criteria. For this report, which has been  composed according to the &ldquo;Comprehensive&rdquo; option (the broadest expression of  the G4 standard), we have adopted a methodology that requires us to be much  more transparent and much more focused. Furthermore because this report is the  first such to be prepared according to the G4 standard by a state-owned bank in  Turkey, it also constitutes a valuable model and reference.</p>
<h1>Our fundamental responsibility is to pass a livable world and a    sustainable future on to the generations that come after us.</h1>
<p>In the    process of achieving robust development and building the future, we regard    sustainability as one of the essential elements that show Ziraat Bank and    its stakeholders the way forward.</p>
<p>We conduct    our activities in a state of synergetic interaction with a community of    stakeholders that is extensive and global in scale. Our core stakeholders    consist of our shareholder, our employees, our customers, and our suppliers;    in the broadest sense our stakeholders also include regulatory agencies,    international financial institutions and investors, media concerns and    professional organizations, and society at large. We focus on conducting our    operations in collaboration with all of our stakeholders in a manner which is    mutually respectful and which balances everyone&rsquo;s interests. We believe that    this approach is crucially important to sustainability.</p>
<p>In Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s    view, sustainability means ensuring the viability of an ecosystem that will    allow all of its stakeholders to completely satisfy all of their needs not    just today but equally so in the future as well. The Ziraat Bank Sustainability Policy sets    out the conditions that must exist in order for people and nature to interact    in productive harmony. It provides a way not just for us but for future    generations as well to satisfy their social, economic, and communal needs.</p>
<p>In line    with this, we have come to recognize issues that are of the utmost concern on    the global agenda–among them climate change, the transition to a low-carbon    economy, and social development–as being high-priority matters of our own.    Our invariable objective is to make a beneficial difference in these areas in    the conduct of our business. We believe that in order to ensure the    sustainability of their growth and profitability, companies need to be    mindful of the futures of the community and environment in which they live    and that they should engage in comprehensive efforts for the sake of    improvement and progress.</p>
<h1>Our objectives and change</h1>
<p>A    successful pioneer and leader under every condition throughout its long    history and a financial institution that has constantly contributed to the    development of the surroundings in which it operates, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s immutable aims are: 

<ul>
	<li>to contribute to economic,    environmental, and social wellbeing,</li>
	<li>to create enduring value for    its stakeholders,</li>
	<li>to pursue growth while    remaining mindful of the principles of sustainable profitability and    productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The means    whereby we may achieve these aims are embodied entirely in the transformation that we have been managing    strategically for the last three years.</p>
<p>We are    aware that transformation is an ongoing process and that it demands    steadfastness. Ziraat Bank    continues to renew itself, regards the customer as the focal point of all of    its operations, and fulfills the stringent requirements of today&rsquo;s    competitive environment as a pioneering and responsible leader.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank operates at 85 locations in 16 countries around the world. Besides being a global service provider, Ziraat Bank is also a natural bridge in Turkey’s commercial relationships with international markets.</p>
<p>It is when all of these attributes are taken into account together that the meaning, importance, and indispensability that strategic management has for us becomes evident.</p>


<h2 class="sag cizgi">Ziraat Bank for its part stands ready to assume even more duties on a journey which is of concern to the future of our planet and to the people who live on it and which will affect the affluence and living conditions of each and every one of us.</h2>



<h1>The cornerstones of our approach to sustainability</h1>
<p>We regard    our customers, our human resources, our strength to produce long-term performance, our strong balance sheet, and our corporate governance structure as the    cornerstones of our approach to sustainability.</p>
<p>Our    customers are the reason for our existence and the bedrock of our    sustainability. Their regard, confidence, and loyalty make up the cement that    has held together the sectoral leadership of the Ziraat Bank brand for a hundred and    fifty-two years. Our fundamental and immutable goal is to give our customers    the experience of the very best service that our sector has to offer and to    make our strongly-valued products and services a part of their lives.    Feedback received from our customers shows that they are becoming    increasingly more satisfied with what we do and that is what encourages us to    act even more imaginatively.</p>
<p>Let no one    doubt but that Ziraat Bank owes    its sustainability to its employees as well. In order to ensure that this    fact remains true, we constantly invest in our human resources and equip our    personnel with the competencies made necessary by today&rsquo;s rapidly changing    and developing business world.    At Ziraat Bank we    give special importance to cultivating a motivational environment that    encourages teamwork.</p>
<p>It gives    me pleasure to say that, as demonstrated by quantifiable performance criteria    of every kind, our Bank is successfully maintaining a consistent human resources    experience.</p>
<p>Under the    heading of our sustainable and long-term performance objective, we are    undertaking all of our investments with an approach that is mindful of    operational costs and effectiveness. We are successfully keeping our cost    base under control while pursuing without letup our efforts to diversify our    sources of revenue in ways that are compatible with market conditions.</p>
<p>Advanced    corporate governance practices that are fully compliant with the requirements    of law are of crucial importance to our ability to create, maintain, and    increase brand and stakeholder value. At the same time we also give    importance to sustainability management and regard it as an essential element    of our corporate governance structure.</p>


<h2 class="sag cizgi">We are of the opinion that not just governments but also private sector concerns, civil-society initiatives, universities and indeed everyone else have important duties and responsibilities with respect to sustainable development.</h2>
<h1>On the future</h1>
<p>
	2015, the    year we have prepared this report for publication, was witness to new    undertakings and successes on our Bank&rsquo;s part. It was also a year in which Ziraat Bank    abided by its Sustainability Policy as it pursued its goals of:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>making a bigger contribution to    Turkey&rsquo;s economic development,</li>
	<li>protecting the environment,</li>
	<li>constantly expanding the value    that it adds to society.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are    determined both to take a multidimensional approach in the conduct of our    activities with respect to such issues and to deploy the extraordinary    financial leverage that the scale of our operations makes possible in order    to expand the scope of sustainability.</p>
<p>When our    suppliers, employees, and the millions of firms and individuals to which we    have lent are taken into account as a whole, the dimensions and extent of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s    contributions to and impact on economic development and social wellbeing    become unmistakably apparent. Ziraat Bank seeks to provide this huge    community with guidance and leadership in order both to strengthen the foundations    of sustainability throughout society at large and to create a multiplier    effect that amplifies the added value that the Bank generates itself.</p>
<p>Helping    our country&rsquo;s farmers to make the best possible use of water and other    natural resources, to increase their productivity, and to strengthen    themselves competitively; increasing the production capacity of our country&rsquo;s    SMEs and encouraging them to further improve their operational conditions in    light of universal values; and achieving greater energy and all other    resource use efficiency in every business in every sector are just a few of    the countless ways in which we can work together with our stakeholders to    create more value.</p>
<p>We are of    the opinion that not just governments but also private sector concerns,    civil-society initiatives, universities and indeed everyone else have important duties and    responsibilities with respect to sustainable development.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank for    its part stands ready to assume even more duties on a journey which is of    concern to the future of our planet and to the people who live on it and    which will affect the affluence and living conditions of each and every one    of us.</p>
<p>One of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s    most vital goals therefore is to achieve this by marshalling all of its    self-confidence, energy, dynamism, institutionalized business processes, IT    infrastructure, superior human resources, and unrivaled financial strength.</p>
<p>In closing    and speaking both personally and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I offer    my appreciation to everyone for their confidence in, contributions to,    support for, and choice of the Ziraat brand.</p>
<p>I also    invite our stakeholders to share with us their own views and opinions about    our sustainability performance by sending them to our e-mail address on <a href="mailto:surdurulebilirlik@ziraatbank.com.tr">surdurulebilirlik@ziraatbank.com.tr</a>.</p>
<p>Very truly    yours,</p>
