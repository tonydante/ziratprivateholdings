<p class="title">Sustainability at Ziraat Bank-We shape the future</p>

<h2 class="">Work on the infrastructural transformation and corporate development projects that were initiated in 2012 under the “Together, to a Better Future” slogan continued in 2014 as well.</h2>

<p>Recognizing that change is a never-ending journey and aware of the need to constantly renew itself and adapt to today’s tough competitive environment, Ziraat Bank continued to advance together with its stakeholders in 2014.</p>
<p>The comprehensive transformation journey that the Bank embarked upon in 2012 was summed up in its “Together, Further Ahead” slogan in 2014 and projects to that end were initiated.</p>
<p>Under the heading of “Together, Further Ahead”, the Bank is engaged in an ongoing effort to carry out the infrastructural transformation and corporate development projects conforming to the Ziraat Customer Business Model, which was formulated in order to provide customers with the right value at the right time and in the right way. The Bank’s goal in this is to put what it has learned from these projects to good use in the future and to complete its global transformation projects.</p>
<p>The intended aim of the Ziraat Bank Change &amp; Transformation Project is to support the Ziraat Finance Group’s future movement into three main business lines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Corporate Banking</li>
	<li>Branch Banking</li>
	<li>International banking</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, much valuable work continued on the 2014 Strategic Roadmap that was laid out to achieve the Bank’s strategic goals. Progress on the development of this roadmap is being monitored by the Ziraat Bank Strategic Guide Committee.</p>
<h1>Ziraat Bank Change &amp;  Transformation Project priorities</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank also regards the following issues  that it has identified under its Change &amp; Transformation Project as being  high-priority agenda items from the standpoint of its sustainability  performance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Customer relationship management</li>
	<li>Institutionalized business processes</li>
	<li>Operational excellence</li>
	<li>Objective and transparent HR management</li>
	<li>Effective IT</li>
	<li>Strong balance sheet</li>
</ul>
<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s 2014 Strategic Roadmap is rooted  in six fundamental principles that are discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>1)  Customer Relationship Management</strong><br />
	Recognizing that its customers are its most valuable asset, the  establishment of sustainable and added-value-creating relationships between  them and the bank was once again one of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s most important objectives in 2014.</p>
<p>The principle of changing from a &ldquo;Product/Customer-Based Approach&rdquo; to a  &ldquo;Bank Customer-Based Approach&rdquo; that was identified in 2012 was taken to the  next level in 2013 by replacing the concept of &ldquo;bank customer&rdquo; with that of  &ldquo;Ziraat customer&rdquo;. In 2014, infrastructure work was undertaken so as to make it  possible to satisfy all of a customer&rsquo;s financial product and service needs  within the Ziraat Finance Group. The same attention and priority will be given  to efforts undertaken in line with that principle in 2015 as well.</p>
<p>Guided by its principle of serving its customers effectively through  every channel, Ziraat Bank not only increased the number of  its service locations but also speeded up its efforts to provide its disabled  customers with more convenient and accessible service at those locations in  line with its recognized service-accessibility standards.</p>
<p>The branch and non-branch channel design work undertaken as part of the  &ldquo;Banking Without Barriers&rdquo; project in order to make it easier for  physically-challenged customers to access financial services has been completed.  Modification work will begin in 2015 with the aim of encompassing all branches  by the end of 2016.</p>
Seeking to be a strong player in global markets  in line with its Change &amp; Transformation Project, Ziraat Bank  is committed to being a bold leader and to authoring best practices in the area  of customer relationship management.

	Rooted in six fundamental principles, Ziraat Bank’s 2014 Strategic Roadmap plays a crucial role from the standpoint of its sustainability performance.</h2>


<p><br />
	<strong>2)  Institutionalized Business Processes</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s review of its business processes  in order both to digitize those that are still being conducted manually and to  simplify existing digitized processes continued in 2014 within the scope of a  process-management methodology.</p>
<p>In order to power its ongoing development, Ziraat Bank is engaged in efforts to systematically quantify process  performance and to improve processes in line with its strategic priorities and  budget targets. A &ldquo;Ziraat Finance Group Quality Policy&rdquo; is to be formulated  with the aim of ensuring that the same levels of service quality are achieved  both within the Bank and among all of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank constantly develops its lending  processes as a tool for extending its institutionalized appetite for risk into  every place in which it is active.</p>
<p>The essential prerequisites for the effective management of credit risk  consist of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Correctly conveying dynamic lending policies to those who must implement  them in the field</li>
	<li>Fostering a commonly-understood and accepted lending culture</li>
	<li>Effectively monitoring and managing credit risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Support systems that were introduced in 2012 continued to be developed  with the addition of new features in both 2013 and 2014. Newly-introduced  practices made it possible for lendings to be monitored and collected more  effectively. As part of efforts to integrate sustainability principles into all  business processes, it is planned to incorporate environmental- and social-risk  management criteria into lending processes in 2015 as well.</p>
<p><strong>3)  Operational Excellence</strong><br />
	During 2014 Ziraat Bank continued to improve the quality  of the customer experience in customers&rsquo; interactions with branch personnel. Efforts  were made to reduce branches&rsquo; operational workloads through process improvement  and headquarters centralization so that branch personnel could devote more time  to properly identifying customers&rsquo; financial product and service needs and  recommending the best options to them. In 2014 the number of employees directly  involved in operational functions was reduced by 1,204. In the three years to  end-2014, the number of bank employees reassigned to added-value-generating  positions reached 3,220.</p>
<p><strong>4)  Objective and Transparent HR Management</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s human resources policy is  structured so as to make people central to it. An important tenet of this  policy is to promote employee job satisfaction by ensuring that people are  employed in positions that are compatible with their competencies and in which  they can enjoy doing their jobs.</p>
<p>In 2012 Ziraat Bank initiated a changeover from a  title-based, largely vertical organizational structure to a more horizontal  structure based on job descriptions. This process continued in 2014 with the  introduction of practices enabling employees to advance in their job positions  according to their abilities and competencies and also to be promoted based on  their testing performance.</p>
<p>A Management Trainee Program for existing personnel has been started in  order to create an in-house pool of candidates capable of undertaking  management positions. The training provided under this program focuses on  creating the managers of the future.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Individual Performance Evaluation  System was introduced in 2013 to make it possible for employees to be evaluated  objectively on the basis of their performance. That system was augmented in  2014 with the introduction of the Ziraat Competency  Management System, whose aim is to allow employees to be assessed on the basis  of their competencies and then to identify the kinds of training that are  needed so that those competencies may be further improved.</p>
<p>As required by Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  principle of transparency, employees are involved in and made aware of all  innovations in matters affected by the Change &amp; Transformation Project. As part  of this project, a variety of in-house communication channels were opened in  2012 to keep personnel informed about changes that are being made. These  channels continued to be used in 2014 in order to keep employees informed about  the project&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">

	As a financial services provider, Ziraat Bank’s sustainability approach is shaped in light of its responsibilities, its obligations to the environment and the community, and its duties.</h2>


<p><strong>5)  Effective IT</strong><br />
It is Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s principle to maximize the use of  information technology in all of its business processes. The IT infrastructure  and IT hardware replacement projects that were initiated in order to ensure  that all operations can be conducted without interruption and also to optimize  costs continued in 2014 as well. Work was also begun last year on projects to  renovate the Bank&rsquo;s data center.</p>
<p><strong>6)  Strong Balance Sheet</strong><br />
	The principle of equity-compatible balance sheet management continued to  be an important source of guidance for the strategic decisions that were made  in 2014. Profits, which are the most important element of a company&rsquo;s equity,  are retained by Ziraat Bank as a way of further strengthening the Bank&rsquo;s equity  resources.</p>
<p>In keeping with the principle that rational bigness is better than just  bigness, Ziraat Bank seeks to achieve sustainable profitability and growth and  in 2014, it continued its efforts to do so. Steadily increasing the weight of  customers&rsquo; accounts in its balance sheet in order to create increasingly more  value for the national economy, the Bank continued to provide financing support  to the real sector in 2014.</p>
In order to increase the diversity of its  funding, the Bank once again sought to make greater use of non-deposit  resources, renewed its syndicated loans, and issued bank bonds and bills. Last  year Ziraat Bank issued its first eurobonds and tapped  international finance markets on a long-term basis.
