<p class="title"> Employees</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">Ziraat Bank owes its leading position in the Turkish banking industry to its employees. Taking this simple fact as its point of departure, Ziraat Bank manages a human resources policy which puts the employee at its center and whose aim is to let the Bank’s personnel view the future with confidence.</h2>

<h6>G4-DMA</h6>

<p>Regarding its employees as the architects of  its banking business sustainability, Ziraat Bank fulfills its obligations towards its  personnel by compensating them appropriately and equitably and by providing  them with modern working conditions and with opportunities for professional and  personal progression.</p>
<p>Believing that its employees should be  individuals who are capable of keeping pace with the demands of the day and are  open to change and improvement and who have an affinity for teamwork and an  advanced sense of responsibility, Ziraat Bank supports its personnel throughout their  careers in line with its philosophy of constant progress.</p>
<h1>Ziraat Bank human resources highlights</h1>
<h6>G4-LA2</h6>
<ul>
	<li>As of 31 December 2014, Ziraat Bank had 23,617 people on its payroll,  all of whom are employed on a full-time basis.</li>
	<li>More than 85% of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s employees have a university  bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher academic qualifications. The average age of its  employees is 35. The average length of service as of the reporting date was 11  years.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank has more master&rsquo;s and doctorate  degree-holders on its payroll than any other bank in Turkey.</li>
	<li>In 2014 Ziraat Bank added 38 new employees to the  contingent of its staff that it allocates for people with physical  disabilities.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank gives importance to the presence of women  in the workforce. According to <em>Capital</em>,  a magazine, Ziraat Bank ranks fifth among the top one hundred in a  survey of companies in Turkey based on the number of women on their payroll.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s fundamental mission in the area of human  resources is to be the bank that the best people in its industry most want to  work for.</h1>
<p>In its recruitment processes,  Ziraat Bank always focuses on seeking out and  getting the right people for the right jobs and this principle informs every  aspect of those processes. The rights and opportunities that the Bank offers  its personnel also enable them to view the future with confidence.</p>
<p>Every year Ziraat Bank conducts a review of its staffing requirements. Available positions and  the qualifications required for them are published in  the human resources sections of nationally circulating newspapers and they are  also announced on Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  corporate website.</p>
<p>Recruitment exams are conducted by  a specialist organization working under contract with the Bank in order to  identify potential candidates for employment. Anyone who satisfies the minimum  requirements to sit for these exams may apply to do so. Those who receive at  least a passing grade are called in for an interview that is conducted by  experienced Ziraat Bank personnel. Those who pass the  interview successfully are hired. Signing the Ziraat Bank Code of Ethics is one of the  requirements of hiring.</p>
<p>Although no new personnel were  hired in this way in 2014, the application and testing procedure was initiated  and completed during the year in order to identify a large number of people who  are to be recruited and hired in 2015.</p>
<h6>G4-EC6</h6>
<p>In keeping with its principle of hiring  locally where possible, in 2014 Ziraat Bank asked candidates during the recruitment  process to specify which province (city) they preferred to work in.</p>
<h6>G4-LA1</h6>
<p>A total of 1,596 Ziraat Bank employees left the Bank for various  reasons in 2014. The Bank&rsquo;s employee turnover rate last year was 7%.</p>

<h6>G4-DMA</h6>

<h1>Ziraat Bank creates a workplace environment that is modern,  respectful of human rights, and mindful of employee happiness.</h1>
<p>Seeking to increase employees&rsquo;  company loyalty by motivating them and to reward employees for their individual  contributions to the company&rsquo;s success, Ziraat Bank has introduced a performance management system  whose scope is steadily being expanded to embrace all units of the Bank,  including those at its headquarters.</p>
<p>Work is also being conducted on  projects to make information more  generally available more quickly and more economically through e-learning and  mobile training methods. The aim of these projects is to ensure that employees  have access to information whenever they need it. </p>
<p>Explicit and transparent notifications  about job descriptions and assignments and about  performance and reward criteria are sent out by email and published so as to be  accessible to all via the Ziraat Bank internet portal. All instances of  suspected or alleged irregularities, abuse, etc concerning such matters are  investigated by appropriate headquarters units. </p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">More than 85% of Ziraat Bank’s employees have a university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications.</h2>
<h1>The Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management System is  designed to support the constant development and progression of the Bank&rsquo;s  employees.</h1>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management  System is a system for measuring at regular intervals the individual success  and ranking of employees based on objective, quantifiable, and  previously-specified criteria and information. This system was designed and introduced in 2013 in  order to reward superior performance. Its primary function is to enhance the  effectiveness of sales personnel.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management System  has been set up so as to allow personnel to be rated in two different ways  based either on their numerical performance or else on their competencies.  Numerical performance is an expression of the degree to which an employee&rsquo;s  performance conforms to the Bank&rsquo;s strategic targets as measured by objective  criteria associated with each one, the indications of an employee&rsquo;s  competencies (such as their ability to be customer-focused, profitable, and  efficient and to manage risk) can significantly raise or lower their numerical  performance score.</p>
<p>In the implementation of this system, a  current bonus budget was allocated taking the Bank&rsquo;s profitability and  operational results in 2014 into account with the proviso that their total  amounts not exceed 8% of the Bank&rsquo;s aggregate monthly salary payments. This  allocation is paid out to recipients as an individual performance bonus at  three-month intervals along with their February, May, August, and November  salaries based on objectively defined and numerically expressible specific  criteria. In this system, which has been set up to focus mainly on marketing in  line with the Bank&rsquo;s strategies and targets, bonuses are calculated so as to  enhance the earnings of those who contribute more to the realization of those  strategies and targets and paid to employees according to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>branch segment and scale group,</li>
	<li>rankings that have been determined according to  individual performance report cards in line with the numerical performance  measurement results at three-month intervals,</li>
	<li>employees&rsquo; performance bonus coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The different coefficients that are used when calculating bonuses are  determined jointly by business units according to branch segment and scale,  individual performance ranking, and job position criteria.</p>
Under a new procedure introduced for the third  quarter of 2014, marketing group personnel bonuses were calculated in direct  proportion to the numerical performance points in each section. Beginning with  the fourth quarter of that year, the bonuses of counter personnel were  calculated based on the performance of the counter to which they were assigned.
<h2 class="sag cizgi">Most of the work related to Competency-Based Performance Management project had been completed as of end-2014.</h2>

<p>Performance evaluation results are used as input when determining  employees&rsquo; assignments and promotions as well as their performance bonuses. Field  personnel who are subject to numerical-based performance evaluation consist of  those who are employed in coordinatorships and regional offices and in branches  and those who are employed in portfolio and operations units. Headquarters  personnel who are subject to the system consist of those who are employed in  Company Analysis, Project Analysis, and Operations Center units.</p>
<p>In the case of Competency-Based Performance Management, position- and  unit-based competency specifications together with most of the evaluation  system design and software work had been completed as of end-2014. Ziraat Bank plans to have its Competency-Based Performance Management System up  and running some time in 2016.</p>
<h1>In 2015 Ziraat Bank will continue to provide its employees  with modern working conditions and career progression opportunities appropriate  to their positions.</h1>
<p>The Bank will also continue to enrich career path opportunities both  through in-position advancements and through promotions to higher positions.</p>
<p>Personnel who have reached the Authorized level and whose participation  in the Ziraat Bank Management Trainee Program in 2015  is successful will continue to be appointed to branch manager positions as  needs arise.</p>
<p>A project is currently being conducted to allow requests and opinions  concerning changes in employees&rsquo; job assignments and locations to be submitted  online covering the periods of June-July and December-January.</p>
<p>The Bank plans to update its HR rules and revise some of its HR  processes in order to bring them into accord with changes and practices  introduced by the collective bargaining agreement that was signed with the Öz Finans-İş trade union on 31 December 2014.</p>
<h1>Employee Performance Evaluation at Ziraat Bank: Secret  Customer Program</h1>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Secret Customer Program was introduced  in 2014 in order to obtain additional performance evaluation input by  determining such issues as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the degree to which employees are complying with business targets and  standards,</li>
	<li>the adequacy of employees&rsquo; efforts to acquire new customers for the Bank,</li>
	<li>how effective employees are in imparting their product knowledge to  customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the coordinated quarterly (three-monthly) Secret Customer  Program performance evaluations that were conducted during 2014 were compiled  in reports that were sent out to appropriate units of the Bank for their  information. Authorized Branch, Regional Department, and Headquarters users are  now able to display polling result details from the web reporting page.</p>
<p>This program will continue to be conducted at three-month intervals  until the end of 2016.</p>

<h6>G4-DMA, G4-LA11</h6>

<h1>Ziraat Bank is an employer that adheres to a transparent  career-management approach.</h1>
<p>As a requirement of its people-focused HR policy, it is very important  for Ziraat Bank that people be employed in  positions that are compatible with their competencies. Similarly, the Bank also  endeavors to fill its management position vacancies in-house from among its own  staff.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, Ziraat Bank  has moved away from a vertical, title-based organizational structure in favor  of a more horizontal structure that is based on job descriptions. With this  changeover, the concept of &ldquo;job position&rdquo; has also been incorporated into the Bank&rsquo;s  career management processes. Besides holding a title that defines their place  in the professional hierarchy, every employee is also associated with a &ldquo;job  position&rdquo; that describes what they do, what customer segment they do it for,  and whether they are involved in marketing or operations.</p>
<p>A Management Trainee Program has been started in order to meet the Bank&rsquo;s  need for management personnel. The training provided under this program focuses  on creating the managers of the future.</p>
<p>In the conduct of its promotions program in 2014, 25.16% of Ziraat Bank employees took part in written examinations and/or interviews  determine their readiness to be promoted to a higher position. A total of 4,006  employees received promotions as a result of their successful performance  during these exams.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi"><strong>4,006 employees</strong><br />

<h6>G4-51, G4-52, G4-53</h6>
<h1>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s pay policy is rooted in the principle of  fairness.</h1>
<p>The salaries and compensation paid to Ziraat Bank personnel undergo a year-end annual review for each coming year.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s remuneration system was reviewed  during 2013 and a number of changes that were identified in light of existing  needs went into effect on 1 January 2014. One of these is a supplementary  payment that is made in lieu of promotion to personnel who have satisfied the  minimum seniority requirement for promotion to a higher position than their  current one but are not promoted. This payment is made in addition to their  regular salary.</p>
<p><strong>Remuneration  Committee</strong><br />
	The Ziraat Bank Remuneration Committee is  responsible for monitoring and supervising remuneration practices on behalf of  the Bank&rsquo;s Board of Directors. This committee reviews and assesses remuneration  policies and practices in order to determine their compatibility with the Bank&rsquo;s  code of ethics, strategic objectives, and risk management principles and it  makes recommendations concerning them to the Board of Directors at regular  intervals.</p>
<p>The remuneration that is paid to the Bank&rsquo;s CEO and to the  members of its board of directors is decided upon at each year&rsquo;s general  meeting. Such payments are determined in line with a proposal that is made by the  representative of the Treasury Undersecretariat.</p>
<h6>G4-DMA, G4-LA13</h6>
<p>All salary compensation and other emoluments at Ziraat Bank are paid to employees exclusively on the basis of their job titles  and duties without consideration being given to gender or any other distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Collective  Bargaining Agreement</strong><br />
A number of provisions applicable to remuneration policy and contained  in the collective bargaining agreement with the Öz Finans-İş trade union went into effect as of 1  January 2015.</p>
<p>The Öz Finans-İş trade union was authorized to negotiate  collective bargaining agreements with Ziraat Bank  under letter 75014829/103.03/16164 dated 7 September 2014 from the Ministry of  Labor and Social Security (General Directorate of Labor). Negotiations, which  were conducted pursuant to article 47 of Statute 6356, were concluded as of 31  December 2014 and resulted in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  signing the first collective bargaining agreement in its history.</p>
Under this two-year contract, which went into  force on 1 January 2015, Bank personnel who are members of the Öz Finans-İş trade  union enjoy a number of additional rights that include supplementary payments  in their monthly salary and leave time.

	70.2% of Ziraat Bank’s employees are union members as a consequence of the Bank’s respectful and protective attitude to employee rights.

	</h2>



<h6>G4-11, G4-LA4</h6>
<p>The contract also specifies notice periods that must be complied with  when work agreements are to be terminated by the employer or by an employee.</p>
<p>70.2% of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s employees are union members.</p>
<p><strong>Pensions  and Retirement Benefits</strong><br />
	A group pension scheme to which the employer also contributes went into  effect for Ziraat Bank employees as of 1 January 2013.  This scheme is being managed by Ziraat Hayat ve Emeklilik AŞ, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s life insurance and pension provider subsidiary. Under the  original terms of the agreement, Ziraat Bank  agreed to pay an employer&rsquo;s contribution of not more than 3% of a participating  employee&rsquo;s gross monthly salary, provided that the employee did the same,  except that in neither case could the contributions be less than TL&nbsp;50 a  month.</p>
<p>Effective 1 January 2014, the employer&rsquo;s monthly contribution was fixed  at a flat-rate TL&nbsp;50 while the matching employee contribution requirement  was abolished. The employer&rsquo;s contribution was increased to TL&nbsp;100/month  as of 1 January 2015. Under the terms of the same pension scheme, Bank  employees and their relatives who sign up for the plan do not have to pay  entrance or administrative fees and they also qualify for a management fee  discount.</p>
<p><strong>Overtime</strong><br />
	In principal, employees are expected to complete a regular day&rsquo;s work  within regular working hours. In 2014 a system was introduced at the Bank that  enables the overtime that branch and regional unit personnel put in to be  tracked methodically. Besides standardizing payments for overtime throughout  the Bank and making them more transparent, this system has also made it  possible to determine units&rsquo; staffing requirements more effectively.</p>
<p>Attention is given to units and personnel claiming large amounts of  overtime, the reasons for excessive overtime are investigated, and measures are  taken to reduce it.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare  and benefits</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank employees who are not civil  servants and their family members qualify for regular Social Security Agency  healthcare and benefits. Principles and procedures have also been laid out that  allow additional healthcare benefits to be paid to them out of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s budget subject to allocations authorized by the Board of  Directors. Bank personal who are members of the TZHVakfı Health &amp; Pension Fund receive  payments from its budget.</p>
<p>The Bank has also entered into special agreements with healthcare  providers such as hospitals, medical imaging centers, and doctors&rsquo; surgeries  where its employees qualify for discounts. Information about such places is  accessible to all employees via the Bank&rsquo;s internet portal.</p>
<p><strong>Employee  leave</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank employees&rsquo; paid annual leave  entitlements are subject to general provisions of labor law governing such  matters. Union-member employees who have been working for the Bank for less  than five years qualify for fourteen rather than sixteen days of paid annual  leave. Ten days of this leave must be taken as a single, uninterrupted block of  time. Announcements concerning this rule are made regularly. Employees&rsquo; use of  their leave time is tracked closely.</p>

<h1>Contributing to the environment through extensive use of  e-learning</h1>
<p>Owing to the dimensions and reach of its service network, Ziraat Bank makes extensive use of e-learning in the conduct of its training  activities in support of regular classroom training. Besides making it possible  to provide more training to more people in less time and without interrupting  work schedules, e-learning also means that people can access training materials  and resources whenever and wherever it is convenient and also proceed at their  own pace. By reducing the need to travel to and from training venues,  e-learning even makes its own indirect contribution to environmental wellbeing.  118,277 employees took part in the Bank&rsquo;s e-learning programs in 2014.</p>
<h6>G4-SO4</h6>
<p>During the year, Bank employees were also provided with training on  issues related to the prevention of money-laundering and terrorism financing.  Detailed information about this training is provided in the accompanying chart.  97.97% of all Ziraat Bank personnel have taken part in this  training.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ziraat&rsquo;e Hoşgeldiniz&rdquo; (&ldquo;Welcome to Ziraat&rdquo;) is a booklet  which has been prepared and is distributed to newly-hired personnel as a handy  source of information to introduce them to the Bank and its corporate culture  and to ease them into their jobs.</p>
<h1>Training activities planned for 2015 </h1>
<p><strong>1) The  Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank Learning  Management System will be commissioned. This system will allow:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Training activities to be designed more effectively,</li>
	<li>E-learning resources to be created faster,</li>
	<li>Personnel who take training-related tests and respond to polls to see  their results immediately,</li>
	<li>Faster and more convenient access to information about employees&rsquo;  classroom training and e-learning activities, to information about classroom  and accommodation availability and use, and to training documentation,</li>
	<li>Online monitoring of the progress of training processes such as  requests, approvals, and cancellations etc,</li>
	<li>Faster and more accurate tracking, quantifying, and reporting of  training activities as they take place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2)  Distance learning modules based on the findings of the New Auditing Model</strong><br />
	These modules will allow the New Auditing Model&rsquo;s  findings to be used in order to formulate training that is entirely needs-based  and even personalized. Distance learning modules will be designed so as to  ensure that such training is made accessible to bank employees faster. This  will have the additional benefit of allowing an individual to complete  identified training requirements as well.</p>
<p><strong>3)  Mobile training materials for managers and authorized personnel</strong><br />
	Training materials in the form of mobile apps will allow these personnel  to do their training whenever and wherever it is convenient. Designed to be  succinct and brief, such training can be supported by means of video, audio,  visuals, and text without any need for additional infrastructure investment.</p>
<p><strong>4) Use  of performance management data to analyze training requirements</strong><br />
	The Bank plans to organize training and development programs that target  areas in which its employees need to improve their basic, functional, and  managerial competencies.</p>

<h1>Employee health and safety concerns are fundamental elements  of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s human resources policies and practices.</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank ensures that it is in full  compliance with the Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act (Statute 6331). The Bank  is classified as a &ldquo;low-risk workplace environment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As required by that act, a Ziraat Bank  Occupational Health &amp; Safety Coordination Committee has been set up and is  charged with fulfilling its occupational health and safety duties and  responsibilities as an employer. This committee is presided over by the  Assistant General Manager for Financial Coordination. It members consist of  relevant department heads, workplace physicians, safety officers, and employee  representatives.</p>
<p>The duties and authorities of the Ziraat Bank Occupational Health &amp; Safety Coordination Committee include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Preparing internal occupational health &amp; safety directives  appropriate to the workplace environment; submitting these for the  consideration and approval of employer and employee representatives; monitoring  compliance with directives; reporting the results of such monitoring;  identifying issues and bringing them to the attention of the  Committee,</li>
	<li>Ensuring that employees are provided with occupational health &amp;  safety guidance when they are in need of it,</li>
	<li>Assessing workplace occupational health &amp; safety risks and the  effectiveness of measures to counter them; identifying measures that need to be  taken and notifying employer/employee representatives accordingly,</li>
	<li>Investigating and examining every workplace accident, any potentially  harmful incident even if it is not treated as a workplace accident, any  instance of work-related illness, and any threat to workplace health and  safety; identifying and reporting on measures that need to be taken and  notifying employer/employee representatives accordingly,</li>
	<li>Planning workplace occupational health &amp; safety training and  instruction; preparing programs concerning such issues and the rules applicable  to them; submitting these for the consideration and approval of employer and/or  employee representatives as appropriate; monitoring compliance and reporting  infractions,</li>
	<li>Planning safety measures that need to be taken during the conduct of  workplace maintenance and repairs; checking that such measures are properly  taken,</li>
	<li>Observing the adequacy and effectiveness of measures and teams for  dealing with workplace risks arising from fire, natural disasters, sabotage,  and the like,</li>
	<li>Preparing annual reports concerning workplace occupational health &amp;  safety issues; assessing each year&rsquo;s occupational health &amp; safety  performance; identifying issues based on experience that need to be addressed  in the next year&rsquo;s program; submitting these to the employer,</li>
	<li>Urgently convening and deciding what to do whenever employees exercise  their right to refrain from work on the grounds of article 13 of the  Occupational Health &amp; Safety Act (Statute 6331),</li>
	<li>Developing a coherent and comprehensive occupational health &amp; safety  policy that embraces and deals with all aspects of workplace technology,  organization, conditions, social interactions, and environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mandated by law, the Ziraat Bank  Occupational Health &amp; Safety Coordination Committee convenes regularly at  least once every three months. During these meetings, participants discuss  issues applicable to their duties and authorities such as Bank employee H&amp;S  training, first aid training, regular health checkups, regular tests and care,  risk assessment reporting, drills and evacuation procedures, and issues  involving subcontractors.</p>
<p>During 2014, 3,752 people were provided with occupational health &amp;  safety training at Ziraat Bank.</p>
<p>No Bank personnel are employed in jobs that expose them to high risk of  accident or of contracting particular illnesses.</p>
<p>During 2014, no workdays were lost at the Bank for such reasons as  workplace-related injuries, occupational illnesses, strikes, lockouts, natural  disasters, or building destruction or collapse.</p>
<p>Similarly neither were there any fatal workplace accidents at Ziraat Bank in 2014.</p>
<p>The collective bargaining agreement between Ziraat Bank and the Öz Finans-İş trade  union also contains occupational health &amp; safety provisions governed by  Statute 6331 and its applicable regulations and  directives.</p>

<h1>Ziraat Bank strives to ensure the sustainability of a  participatory and collaborative work environment.</h1>
<p>Because it gives great importance to employee communication,  Ziraat Bank makes use of a variety  of channels in order to ensure the effectiveness of such communication. </p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank Employee Suggestion System</strong><br />
	Adhering to and supporting innovative approaches in employee  communication, Ziraat Bank regards its employees&rsquo;  suggestions and feedback as opportunities to constantly make improvements.</p>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank introduced an employee suggestion system which is actively  used by all Bank employees and which ensures that their suggestions are directed  quickly to appropriate persons and dealt with. The objectives of the Ziraat Bank Employee Suggestion  System are to involve employees in decision-making mechanisms, to have the  benefit of employees&rsquo; knowledge and experience, to encourage employees to  come up with improvements, and to constantly enhance service quality and  efficiency. </p>
<p>Thanks to this system, it is possible for employees&rsquo;  suggestions to be received and acted upon immediately by the units concerned  with them. During 2014, 7,205 suggestions were sent through the Ziraat Bank Employee Suggestion  System and acted upon as deemed necessary.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">Under the new transfer requests system introduced in 2014 at Ziraat Bank, employees wishing to be reassigned to a different place may forward their request to the Human Resources Department with the approval of their supervisor.</h2>

<p><strong>Transfer Request System</strong><br />
In 2014 a new system for receiving and handling employees&rsquo;  transfer requests was introduced. Under this new system, employees wishing to  be reassigned to a different place may forward their request to the Human  Resources Department at designated times of the year and  with the approval of their supervisor. </p>
<p>This system includes a scoring module that allows these requests to be  evaluated objectively. Another feature of this system is that it allows  managers to contribute to the employee career progression process by  recommending changes in an employee&rsquo;s job assignment based on their own  assessment of the individual&rsquo;s abilities.</p>
<p>In situations where such changes would have an impact on an employee&rsquo;s  entitlement rights, the individual is notified in writing and given six  business days in which to accept or reject the changes.</p>
