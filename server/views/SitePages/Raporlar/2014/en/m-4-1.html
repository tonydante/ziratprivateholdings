<p class="title">Corporate Social Responsibility</p>

<h2>Ziraat Bank conducts enduring social responsibility projects whose aims are to protect cultural values, to contribute to the communal heritage, and to uphold traditions and customs.</h2>
<p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a concept involving the integration  of social and environmental criteria into a company&rsquo;s business activities and  the establishment of a voluntarily dialogue between the company and its  stakeholders about such matters.</p>
<p>CSR is beneficial not just because it makes a company more competitive  in international markets, encourages its employees to be more active in  business processes, helps protect the environment, and contributes to the  development of civil society collaborations but also because it is an important  element of its sustainable development and success in the social arena.</p>
<p>For a company to incorporate CSR into its business strategies not  because it is legally required to but because it wants to is regarded as the  most ideal approach and the most sustainable way of achieving such beneficial  results.</p>
<h2 class="sag"><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/Raporlar/2014/images/i4.jpg"  /></h2>

<h1>For over a century and a half Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  actions have been informed by its spirit of social collaboration and by its  conscientious contributions to social wellbeing.</h1>
<p>While the Bank engages in a wide range of activities intended both to  create communal value and to nurture individual improvement, it gives particular  attention to endeavors in the areas of culture, art, sport, and education.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank designs and conducts enduring  social responsibility projects whose aims are to protect cultural values, to  contribute to the communal heritage, and to uphold traditions and customs. The  Bank regards this as more than just a duty and rather as an outcome of its  mission.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility  activities in 2014 are summarized below.</p>
<h1>The first of its kind: The Ziraat Bankası Banking Museum</h1>
<p>Turkey&rsquo;s first museum devoted to  banking, the Ziraat Bankası  Banking Museum opened its doors to the public on 20 November 1981. Occupying  the ceremonial hall of the Bank&rsquo;s original headquarters building in the Ulus district of Ankara, the museum  provides a look at the Bank&rsquo;s 151-year history.</p>
<p>Besides being an important source of  information about Imperial- and Republican-period history, the Ziraat Bankası Banking Museum also houses examples of  objects used in the Turkish banking industry together with peerless examples of  Turkish art. Also on display is a panoramic view of the progress and  development of banking in Turkey.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">In the 1990s Ziraat Bank increased its support for art. The 34 exhibitions that were mounted in the Bank’s Ankara Kuğulu and İstanbul Tünel galleries in 2014 were attended by more than 28 thousand people.</h2>

<h1>An enduring Ziraat Bank  tradition: Supporting art and artists</h1>
<p>Guided by its slogan &ldquo;Through Art For  Art&rdquo;, Ziraat Bank has been displaying its support  for art and artists through the systematic projects that it has undertaken  throughout its corporate history.</p>
<p>In the 1990s Ziraat Bank increased its support for art by providing new venues for artists  and art lovers to come together and opening its Kuğulu, Tünel, and Kızıltan Ulukavak art  galleries and the Ömer Nafi Güvenli  Exhibition Hall.</p>
<p>The 34 exhibitions that were mounted in  the Bank&rsquo;s Ankara Kuğulu and İstanbul Tünel  galleries in 2014 were attended by more than 28 thousand people.</p>
<h1>Enhancing our value to society: The Ziraat Bank Art Collection</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank is aware of the important role that culture and art play as mirrors  of society in efforts to reach audiences and convey messages about social  progress and advancement to them.</p>
<p>It is because of this awareness that  the Bank has been actively engaged in programs to promote cultural and artistic  activities since 1863. Throughout its history Ziraat Bank has acquired precious paintings  and sculptures by leading artists of the day and added them to an ever  more-distinguished collection.</p>
<p>That collection begins with examples  from the early 19th century that bear the historical stamp of Ottoman-period  society while embracing its progressive development and continues with others  that bear witness to the developmental changes that the arts have gone through  ever since, right down to the present day.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Art Collection is a  vast treasure-trove of works ranging from Romantic landscapes to Impressionist  and Symbolist interpretations, from Expressionist approaches to Cubist explorations,  from the bold abstractions of the Paris School to Gestural and Geometrical  Abstraction, and from compositions rooted in traditional values and social  realities to avant-garde experimentation and the works of Modern and Postmodern  artists.</p>
<p>Beside behaving as an exemplar of a  conscientious art collector, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s commitment to being a pioneer in  society&rsquo;s cultural progress is shown by the way in which it shares the works in  its collection with the public through the comprehensive exhibitions that it  organizes and through a book that documents the implications and results of  informed, proper, sound, and methodically- and systematically-supported  collecting that is consistent with artistic criteria.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank art collection consists of more than 2,500 works, the majority of  which are oil paintings but which also include watercolors, gouaches, pastels,  prints, ceramics, and sculptures. The collection continues to be enriched  through acquisitions from among works exhibited by artists at Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s galleries.</p>
A project is currently under way to restore a  bank-owned 19th-century building in İstanbul&rsquo;s Cağaloğlu district.  When completed, this structure will serve as the Ziraat Bank Museum of Painting  and Sculpture, a venue in which the bank plans to make the works in its  collection accessible to art lovers.

</h2>

<h1>Protecting the culture heritage: Ziraat Bank  building conservation</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank is the owner of buildings located  in Ankara and İstanbul as well as in many other cities that  are important in the history of Turkish architecture. The Bank regards and  protects these buildings as precious elements of the country&rsquo;s culture  heritage.</p>
<p>Fifty-two of these buildings belonging to the Bank are listed/protected  monuments that were erected after 1910 and are still in active use today.  Ziraat Bank plays a part in protecting Turkey&rsquo;s cultural heritage by carrying  out maintenance and repair work that is faithful to the structures&rsquo; original  architectural spirit.</p>
<h1>Systematic and sustainable support for Turkish volleyball</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank has been supporting volleyball as  a sport in Turkey for years through the Ziraat Bank Sports Club. The club has launched a campaign to make the sport  appealing to children all over the country. In the first stage of this program,  the club attracted four hundred children through free-of-charge &ldquo;volleyball  schools&rdquo; in the ten provinces of Adana, Bartın,  Diyarbakır, Eskişehir, Hatay, Kahramanmaraş, Konya, Kocaeli, Mersin, and  Tekirdağ.</p>
<p>In the second stage of the program, Ziraat Bank has set its eye on the goal of nurturing volleyball players who are  talented enough to wear the national colors through its &ldquo;Ten National Athletes  in Ten Provinces&rdquo; project.</p>
<h1><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/Raporlar/2014/images/ziraatkupasi.png" alt="" width="88" height="102" class="floatleft" />Ziraat Bank the Turkish Cup name  sponsor once again in the 2014/2015 season</h1>
<p>Both in keeping with its efforts to support sports in general and in  recognition of their contributions both to social wellbeing and the Bank&rsquo;s  public face, Ziraat Bank once again served as the Turkish  Cup name sponsor for the 2014/2015 season.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank has been the Turkish Cup name  sponsor since the 2009/2010 season and will remain so until the end of the  2016/2017 season.</p>
<p>In the 2014/2015 season, Ziraat Bank  continued to sponsor a sports club that has been successfully representing the  bank in the Aroma Men&rsquo;s Premier Volleyball League since the 2007/2008 season.</p>
<p>In 2014 new versions of the bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shadows&rdquo; and &ldquo;Football Machine&rdquo; TV  spots were broadcast.</p>
<h1>Support for scholarly publications</h1>
<p>Under the &ldquo;Yunus Emre  Institute&rsquo;s 100 Turkish Libraries&rdquo; project, which was launched in 2012, Ziraat Bank continued to make an important contribution to scholarly research  by supporting the establishment of one hundred Turkish libraries in different  countries around the world in 2014.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">In 2014, Ziraat Bank supported the “Osmanlı Kent Yıllıklarında Ankara: Salname-i Vilayet-i Ankara”, “Kütahya Atlas” and “Turkish Poets and Poetries of the Century” projects.</h2>
<h1>Support for historical and cultural publications</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank also engages in projects whose aim  is to ensure that the country&rsquo;s historical and cultural heritages are handed on  intact to future generations. In 2014 the bank supported the &ldquo;Osmanlı Kent Yıllıklarında Ankara: Salname-i Vilayet-i  Ankara&rdquo; adlı eser ile &ldquo;Kütahya Atlas&rdquo;<strong> </strong>and  &ldquo;Turkish Poets and Poetries of the Century&rdquo; projects.<strong></strong></p>
<h1>&ldquo;Kids On Vacation/School Under Repairs&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Under the &ldquo;Kids On Vacation/School Under Repairs&rdquo; project, schools  located in government-designated &ldquo;Priority Developments Regions&rdquo; undergo  repairs and refurbishment. In 2014 Ziraat Bank  continued to make an important contribution to the future of the country by  fixing up and fitting out its children&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<h1>&ldquo;Seyyah: Ulu Çınarın İzinde&rdquo;  Project</h1>
<p>First introduced in the summer of 2012 with Ziraat Bank support to contribute to the individual and social development of  economically deprived children and youths by taking them on trips to  interesting places around the country, this program continued in 2013 and 2014.</p>
<h1>Participation in conferences and other events</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank seeks to contribute not just to  the growth and development of Turkey&rsquo;s agriculture and industry but also to  sociocultural and economic development as well. In keeping with this aim, in  2014 the Bank once again took part in and supported many different culture  &amp; art festivals and other events such as World Food Day, World Environment,  and the annual &ldquo;Golden Pen Awards&rdquo; ceremony for economics journalists.</p>
