<div class="dartext">

  <p class="hilite"><strong>Esteemed stakeholders,</strong></p>
  <p class="hilite"><strong>As a team, we are all proud and honored to be sharing our first  sustainability report with you in our 150<sup>th</sup> year in business.</strong><br />
    <br />
    Mindful of its stakeholders under every condition and conducting  its activities so as to create the highest possible value for them, Ziraat Bank  has successfully overcome every hardship faced by our country and the world  over the last century and a half. Not just a witness to history, our Bank  spearheaded economic and social progress and has always stood beside and  supported this country&rsquo;s people in a period spanning the final years of the  Ottoman Empire and the entire history of the Republic of Turkey.</p>
  <p>The vast knowledge and  experience that Ziraat Bank has built up over the years have made it the  natural leader of its sector.</p>
  <p>Today Ziraat Bank  provides employment directly to about 25 thousand people. In&nbsp;some 400 of  Turkey&rsquo;s small towns located all over the country it is the only local  financial services provider. Today Ziraat Bank is gearing up for the future as  a global player and is advancing sure-footedly in that direction.</p>
  <p><strong>Our responsibility, stakeholders, sustainability, and Ziraat Bank</strong> <br />
    We are aware that our fundamental responsibility at this point  is to pass on a livable world and a sustainable future for the generations that  come after us. For this reason, we regard sustainability as an essential guide  that will show us the way forward as we build that sustainable future.</p>
  <p>Ziraat Bank has a broad  and widespread stakeholder base. Shareholders, employees, customers, and  suppliers make up our core stakeholder group. Regulatory agencies,  international banks and investors, media, professional bodies and associations,  and the public at large are actors that we communicate on a daily basis also. </p>
  <p>We are focused to carry  on our activities within collaboration, respect and balance with our  stakeholders, and we regard this as a crucial aspect of sustainability. </p>
  <p>In our view,  sustainability means ensuring the viability of an ecosystem that will allow our  stakeholders to satisfy their needs in the future at least as well as they do  today.</p>
  <p>Sustainability rests  upon a straightforward principle. Sustainability reveals the conditions that  are necessary for people and nature to exist in productive harmony and it  provides opportunities not just to us but to future generations as well to  satisfy everyone&rsquo;s social, economic, and communal needs.</p>
  <p>This is why we regard  the issues of climate change, transition to a low-carbon economy, and social  development that have been high-priority items on the world&rsquo;s agenda for the  last two decades as equally important for ourselves and why we have accepted,  as our ultimate goal, making a positive difference in this direction through  our product and service processes.</p>
  <p>We sincerely believe  that companies today must be mindful of the future of the society and  environment in which they live and that they must be actively engaged in making  improvements and progress on such matters in order to ensure the sustainability  of their own growth and profitability.</p>
  <p><strong>We give great importance to managing and reducing our ecological  footprint. </strong> <br />
    We know that our own  industry&rsquo;s environmental impact is low compared with other business endeavors.  However we also know that even the smallest individual effort is important in  achieving global objectives and therefore we focus on properly and effectively  managing our environmental impact and use of natural resources, including but  not limited to, energy and water. At the same time, we also intend to  meticulously abide by sustainability principles in our product and service  processes and to author projects that will serve as guides for our  stakeholders, constitute best practices in our sector, and be inspiring to all.  In&nbsp;short, we intend to be role models in the matter of sustainability as  well.</p>
  <p>For a hundred and fifty  years Ziraat Bank has been marshaling its unrivaled knowledge and experience to  correctly interpret the priorities of a changing world and to act accordingly.  It continues to do so today. It will do no less than that tomorrow. Indeed we  are committed to increasing our strength and contributions in all aspects of  sustainability for we know that we have the corporate capacity necessary to  accomplish this.</p>
  <p><strong>The role of our employees</strong><br />
    Our employees have  always lain at the heart of our success. Our employees have begun to play an  active role on sustainability issues and it gives us great pleasure to see that  they are doing so.</p>
  <p>Fully implementing the  sustainability policy that we announced in 2014 and ultimately extending it  throughout the entire Ziraat Finance Group will only be possible through the  strong engagement and efforts of our team. With this in mind, I call upon our  employees to understand and accept that sustainability is a way of life and not  just a corporate goal and to act as a role model on this issue for those around  them.</p>
  <p>Through even the  smallest roles that they are capable of playing, our nearly 25 thousand  employees will make a big contribution towards our efforts to create the broad  social impact that we wish to have. Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s goal is to make its employees  even more motivated on sustainability issues and to encourage them to  participate voluntarily in dealing with them.</p>
  <p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s sustainable future</strong> <br />
    Having laid out its own  growth roadmap in line with Turkey&rsquo;s medium- and long-term vision and  objectives, Ziraat Bank continues to advance confidently into the future.</p>
  <p>Having successfully been  &ldquo;more than a bank&rdquo; for a century and a half, Ziraat Bank will continue to be  the preferred choice of millions of customers in every segment and to create  enduring value in the medium- and long-term future as well through its  unrivaled service quality and its diversified product and service channels.</p>
  <p>We regard corporate  sustainability as a basic tool for achieving the aims briefly set out above. We  also recognize that sustainability is an objective that we must ultimately  achieve in order to compete under the conditions of tomorrow&rsquo;s markets and to  maintain our presence in them as a global player.<br />
    Our Bank has a century  and a half of experience of successfully balancing leadership and  responsibility. Thanks to our customers&rsquo; choices, our employees&rsquo; willingness,  and our suppliers&rsquo; long-term collaboration, we will remain Turkish banking  industry&rsquo;s most highly respected member and a source of its pride.</p>
  <p>Before bringing this  message to an end, I want to invite all of our stakeholders to engage in frank  communication and close cooperation with us. Let us never forget that it is  only by working together that we can keep and improve the world as a livable  place capable of fully meeting our present and future needs.</p>
  <p>I also invite everyone  to send any feedback they may have about Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s sustainability  performance as well as about issues that we can address together to us at <a href="mailto:surdurulebilirlik@ziraatbank.com.tr">surdurulebilirlik@ziraatbank.com.tr</a>.</p>
  <p>Speaking personally and  on behalf of the Ziraat Bank Board of Directors, I express my gratitude to  everyone for trusting, contributing to, supporting, and choosing the Ziraat  Bank brand.</p>
  <p>Very  truly yours,</p>
