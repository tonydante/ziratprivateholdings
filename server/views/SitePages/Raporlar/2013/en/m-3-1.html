<p class="title">The Value Created and Shared</p>
<p class="hilitegri"><strong>Customers</strong><br />
Customers are the essential justification for Ziraat Bank’s existence.</p>



<div class="dartext">

<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  fundamental goal is to perpetuate and augment customer satisfaction and loyalty  by supplying high-value products and services under globally competitive  conditions through all of its delivery channels.</p>
<p>Formulated to ensure  that customers&rsquo; financial needs are satisfied by providing the right solutions  through the right channel at the right times and comprehensively carried out  over the last two years, the Change &amp; Transformation Project has made it  possible to rapidly increase the effectiveness and productivity of its  operations, customer relations, and lending policies and processes.</p>
<p>Through its 1,636  branches and its alternative delivery channels, Ziraat Bank has a geographical  reach more extensive than that of any other bank in Turkey. Indeed in four  hundred small towns, Ziraat Bank is the only local provider of financial  products and services. Such economies of scale together with a century and a  half of banking knowledge and experience, and an extensive portfolio of  national and international subsidiaries will make it possible for Ziraat Bank  to further strengthen its presence in the enterprise, commercial, corporate,  and retail banking segments and to provide even more value to its customers. </p>
<p class="title2">ZIRAAT BANK&rsquo;S SUPPORT FOR THE ECONOMY IS INCREASING STRONGLY.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s loans, through which it supports its customers  directly, increased by 55% in 2013.</strong><br />
  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s activities  are informed by its strategy of achieving balance-sheet dimensions compatible  with its equity. The&nbsp;Bank continued to support the national economy  through its lending activities without any loss of momentum in 2013.  In&nbsp;the twelve months to end-2013, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s total lendings increased  by 55% from TRY&nbsp;71 billion to TRY&nbsp;111 billion.</p>
<p><strong>A rich lineup of products, services, and solutions is evidence of  the value which Ziraat Bank is capable of offering its customers.</strong><br />
  Ranging from deposits to  loans and from foreign trade finance to cash management, all of these products,  services, and solutions are focused on satisfying the financial needs of Ziraat  Bank customers in the best possible way no matter what segment they may be in.</p>
<p>To see Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  current product line categorized by segment please visit: <a href="http://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/en/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/en/index.html </a></p>
<p><strong>Owing to their vital importance to the national economy, small-  and medium-sized enterprises (SME) enjoy a high-priority position in Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s customer base.</strong><br />
  Ziraat Bank supports the  real sector by focusing predominantly on the entrepreneur customer segment and  strategically on the corporate customer segment.</p>
<p>Because they account for  such a big part of the country&rsquo;s commercial and industrial activity, Ziraat  Bank supports SME by providing them with suitably-priced and structured  operating capital and investment credit. The&nbsp;total volume of all cash and  non-cash credit that Ziraat Bank supplied to such firms increased by 102% in  2013.</p>
<p><strong>The deep-rooted and multidimensional cooperation with  international financial institutions and Ziraat Bank, gives an important  opportunity to support SME&rsquo;s sustainable development.</strong><br />
  In order to provide SME  with financing, Ziraat Bank collaborates with many different international  financial institutions such as the World Bank, European Investment Bank (EIB),  the European Investment Fund (EIF), the French Development Agency (AFD), the  Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), and the German Development Bank  (KfW). Two principles are common to all of these collaborations. One is  ensuring that the environmental and social sustainability of projects is as  intrinsic as their economic viability. The&nbsp;other is to concentrate on  projects that will boost SME&rsquo;s competitive strength by ensuring that their  business practices and investments conform to international standards.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank regards its  collaboration with international lenders as important not just for its economic  benefits but also as a means of fostering an appreciation for environmental and  social sustainability among entrepreneurs and SME.</p>
<p>Developments in SME  financing provided through Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s working with international financial  institutions in 2013 are summarized in the following pages.</p>
<p>In its collaboration  with international credit agencies, Ziraat Bank supports sustainable  development by lending to real-sector borrowers on terms with average  maturities of 15 years.</p>

	<p class="dipnot">4) Disbursements of credit drawdowns under these programs will continue in 2014 as well.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank closely  monitors the performance of its SME customers to be sure that they are fully  satisfying the environmental- and social-compliance terms of the World Bank SME  II credit agreement (WB SME II).</strong><br />
As per that agreement, lending under which will cease in  September 2014, projects must fully comply with World Bank environmental and  social procedures as well as with currently applicable environmental laws and  regulations in Turkey in order to qualify for financing.</p>
    <p>World Bank environmental procedures are included as an annex to  the WB SME II agreement and have been published on Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s website.  Ziraat Bank has issued directives that identify &ldquo;prohibited sectors&rdquo; (i.e.  projects that do not qualify for financing) and also spell out in detail World  Bank environmental and social compliance monitoring procedures.</p>
    <p>Under the WB SME II agreement, environmental compliance is  determined essentially on the basis of the &ldquo;Environmental Due Diligence Form&rdquo;.  This document contains a checklist of issues such as the borrower&rsquo;s line of  business, the purposes for which the loan is to be used, and so on. This  checklist is completed and on the basis of the results, an &ldquo;Environmental Management  Plan&rdquo; is drawn up for the project that is to be financed. In&nbsp;the case of a  project whose environmental risks appear to demand special attention and are  therefore subject to preliminary approval as per World Bank Group environmental  criteria, the project is submitted to World Bank Group environmental  authorities for their consideration. Changes in borrowing firms&rsquo; employment,  turnover, and export performance are monitored and sent to the World Bank in  the form of regular progress reports.</p>
    <p>Since the WB SME II agreement is due to expire on  30&nbsp;September 2014, Ziraat Bank has sent a request to the Treasury to have  it extended until 30&nbsp;June 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank support for  energy efficiency projects: WB Energy Efficiency Loan Program</strong><br />
&ldquo;Energy efficiency&rdquo; means minimizing the amount of energy  consumed in production activities without impairing output volumes or quality  and without hampering economic development and/or social wellbeing. This may be  accomplished by preventing losses that occur when energy is being used, by  making waste reusable through recycling, and by increasing efficiency through  technological innovation.</p>
<p>Under a credit agreement signed with the World Bank in 2013,  Ziraat Bank has begun financing SME&rsquo;s energy efficiency projects. In&nbsp;order  for such projects to qualify for financing under the WB SME II program, they  must satisfy at least one of the following energy-efficiency prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upon completion of the project, &ldquo;energy  density&rdquo; (the amount of energy used per unit of output) must be reduced by at  least 20% </li>
  <li>At least 50% of the financial benefit achieved upon completion  of the project must arise from energy efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lending decisions are informed by reports, issued before project  implementation gets under way, assessing whether or not either or both of these  energy-efficiency prerequisites are satisfied. The&nbsp;World Bank has prepared  an &ldquo;Energy Screening Tool&rdquo; that is to be used in the assessment phase.</p>
<p>Loans extended under this program are also subject to the same  environmental- and social-compliance requirements applicable in other World  Bank loans.</p>
<p>In a related vein, Ziraat Bank is about to sign an agreement  with a consultancy that will be responsible for increasing energy-efficiency  awareness among the Bank&rsquo;s employees, for providing them with training on the  energy-efficiency aspects of projects whose financing is being considered, and  on carrying out such projects&rsquo; energy-efficiency pre-assessments. These  activities are being financed by means of an energy-efficiency grant provided  by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p>
<p><strong>Supporting SME through  apex banking as well</strong><br />
The WB SME III credit agreement signed in 2013 calls for Ziraat  Bank supplying SME with USD&nbsp;300 million in funding in its capacity as an  apex bank. These resources will be made available to borrowers through  financial intermediaries (leasing firms and banks authorized to engage in  leasing). Loans extended under this program are also subject to the same  environmental- and social-compliance requirements applicable in other World  Bank loans. Ziraat Bank will be responsible for overseeing such financial  intermediaries&rsquo; compliance with program specifications.</p>
<p><strong>Credit program requiring  compliance with EU environment norms</strong><br />
  In the financing of SME&rsquo;s investments, Ziraat Bank works closely  with the European Investment Bank (EIB).</p>
<p>Under EIB I, a EUR&nbsp;100 million credit facility secured from  EIB to finance SME&rsquo;s projects, an important point to which attention must be  given is the projects&rsquo; compliance with EU environmental regulations and thus  with those in effect in our own country as well. When approving loan  applications under this program, reference is made to a sectoral eligibility  list prepared on the basis of EIB NACE codes, a European industry standard  classification system.</p>
<p>Under EIB I, loans to projects for which an environmental impact  assessment (EIA) report is required, to projects fraught with severe  environmental risks (such as iron &amp; steel industry projects, renewable  energy projects, etc.), and to firms operating in designated conservation areas  are subject to the prior approval of EIB.</p>
<p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank signed an agreement (EIB II) for the first  EUR&nbsp;100 million tranche of credit to be used to finance investments with  similar environmental risks that are being undertaken by small and larger-sized  firms. The&nbsp;Bank plans to sign an agreement covering a second EUR&nbsp;100  million tranche in 2014.</p>
<p class="hilitegri">Nearly 30 thousand customers were provided
priority support for women entrepreneurs
“My First Bank / My First Business” SME loans.</p>
	<p><strong>Priority support for  women entrepreneurs: &ldquo;My First Bank / My First Business&rdquo; SME loans</strong><br />
In November 2012 Ziraat Bank introduced its &ldquo;My First Bank / My  First Business&rdquo; SME credit product consisting of EIB-guaranteed loans. Launched  under the &ldquo;Siftah Ziraatten&rdquo; slogan, the &ldquo;My First Bank / My First Business&rdquo;  campaign targeted customers wishing to start a new business or to expand an  existing one while the EIB guarantee was especially helpful to those who might  otherwise have had trouble putting up collateral.</p>
    <p>Loans supplied under this program automatically benefited from a  20% reduction below currently applicable rates; however in order to give  additional support to women entrepreneurs, loans to their businesses also  qualified for an additional ten percentage-point reduction. Nearly 30 thousand  customers took advantage of &ldquo;My First Bank / My First Business&rdquo; loans. Of the  total amount, more than TRY&nbsp;100 million was lent to 2,578 female  entrepreneurs in support of their efforts to set up their first business.</p>
    <p><strong>Supporting KOSGEB members  in difficult times</strong><br />
      In the wake of a terrorist bomb attack in Hatay&rsquo;s Reyhanlı  township in May 2013, Ziraat Bank stepped in to support customers in the area.  Supplementary support loans were extended in which the Bank assumed  responsibility for the interest normally guaranteed by the Small and Medium  Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB) as well as its own principal  risk. In&nbsp;this way, 64 local customers were provided with nearly TRY&nbsp;5  million in credit support.</p>
    <p>Similarly Ziraat Bank also continued to support those in Van who  had suffered from the disastrous earthquake that recently struck the area.  In&nbsp;2013 the Bank supplied TRY&nbsp;47 million as support credit to nearly  a thousand customers in Van.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank is committed  to continuing to support SME and entrepreneurs active not just in agriculture  but also in other business lines as well.</strong><br />
To fulfill this commitment, Ziraat Bank is exploring new  international loan package opportunities to be offered in addition to the loans  and banking products already being financed out of its own resources.</p>
<p>These programs, whose negotiations are still in progress and are  expected to be finalized by the end of 2014, are briefly summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>French Development Agency  Agricultural Sector Modernization Project</strong><br />
  Negotiations between Ziraat Bank and the French Development  Agency (AFD) have been completed to provide financing for a project which that  agency is conducting jointly with the Food, Agriculture and Livestock Ministry  to modernize small- and medium-sized businesses active in agroindustry and  food-processing.</p>
<p>Lending under this program is expected to begin in 2014  immediately after the signing of an agreement covering the project, which takes  a very careful approach when addressing environmental- and  social-responsibility issues, for which a complete battery of action plans have  been formulated, and which stipulates compliance with applicable environmental  laws and regulations and with corporate social responsibility principles in all  aspects of lending.</p>
<p><strong>German Development Bank  Micro- &amp; Agricultural SME Loan Program</strong><br />
  Discussions with the German Development Bank (KfW) concerning a  10-year, EUR&nbsp;150 million line of credit are expected to be finalized in  2014. This credit is to be used especially in rural areas to finance microloans  to those involved in the agricultural value-creation chain as well as loans to  agricultural SME. In&nbsp;order to benefit from this program, borrowers must  pledge themselves to abide by environmental laws and regulations.</p>

	<p><strong>European Investment Bank  / IPARD</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank and the European Investment Bank (EIB) are currently  engaged in discussions concerning the financing of agricultural projects using  grants-in-aid provided by the EU under the Rural Development component of the  Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPARD). To qualify for financing under  this program, projects must satisfy certain prerequisites (having mainly to do  with human and animal health and welfare issues) set by the Agriculture and  Rural Development Support Agency (TKDK), which carries out IPARD projects in  Turkey. Projects that meet these conditions will receive IPARD grants  commensurate with their TKDK-funded investment once they have become  operational.</p>
The target audience identified for this program consists of firms that  create added value, such as those involved in processing and transport.  In&nbsp;this way, IPARD-funded projects will contribute towards improvements in  both the volume and the quality of agricultural output in Turkey.
	<div class="grikutu">
	  <p><span class="kirmizi">About the IPARD program</span><br />
      Developed to support countries that are already or may become candidates for EU membership, IPARD helps them prepare for, implement, and manage the harmonization of their own agricultural, rural development, and other policies with those commonly in effect throughout the EU. Turkey’s IPARD program was formulated taking into account the country’s pre-accession priorities and needs with respect to rural development.</p>
	  <p>IPARD support is concerned with the following issues: investing in agricultural enterprises that produce milk, investing in agricultural enterprises that produce meat, processing and marketing milk and dairy products, processing and marketing meat and meat products, processing and marketing fruits and vegetables, processing and marketing fishery products, diversifying and developing farm activities, developing local produce and micro-businesses, and developing rural-area tourism and aquaculture.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p><strong>Council of Europe  Development Bank</strong><br />
Signature is pending on a credit agreement between Ziraat Bank  and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB). This seven-year agreement for  EUR&nbsp;100 million consists of two parts, amounting to EUR&nbsp;50 million  each, that are to be lent to SME by Ziraat Bank and Ziraat Leasing  respectively.</p>
    <p>This loan is intended to give SME easier access to credit while  also encouraging them to use leasing as an investment-finance tool. An  autonomous agency of the Council of Europe, CEB adheres to EU standards with  respect to environmental and social responsibility issues and therefore  requires compliance with the European Charter of Human Rights and the European  Social Charter as well as with currently applicable laws and regulations during  the harmonization process.</p>

	<p class="title2">ZİRAAT BANK&rsquo;S APPROACH TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR</p>
    <p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s priority objectives in agricultural sector  financing include fostering the growth and development of Turkish agriculture  and giving it the strength to compete at the global level.</p>
    <p>Maintaining a presence in every aspect of agricultural  production, agroindustry production, and industrial production financing in the  conduct of its Change &amp; Transformation Project, Ziraat Bank has made it its  primary goal to work with all actors on the value-creation chain platform  taking into account the added value that is generated.</p>
    <p>At every stage of agroindustry from soil to shelves, which is to  say from sowing and raising crops to the domestic and international marketing  and sale of agricultural produce, Ziraat Bank engages in efforts that aim is to  stand by its customers in all aspects of their economic activity.</p>
    <p>Foreseeing that agriculture is going to be a business line every  bit as important as energy in the future, Ziraat Bank will continue to be the  biggest supporter of the Turkish agricultural sector as it strives to increase  its efficiency and competitive strength.</p>
	<p><strong>The total value of all  Ziraat Bank lending to finance the agricultural sector reached TRY&nbsp;22.3  billion.</strong><br />
Seeking to be a customer&rsquo;s primary and proactive bank in all  aspects of agricultural production up to and including the final consumer,  Ziraat Bank continued to support the sector in many different ways last year.  At end-2013, the total value of all Ziraat Bank lending to the agricultural sector  amounted to TRY&nbsp;22.3 billion while the number of its loan customers stood  at 566,665.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank lent TRY&nbsp;11.8 billion worth of its own  resources to 342,978 individual and corporate customers and it also extended  TRY&nbsp;305.8 million worth of credit from external funding to 22,899  producers. 47% of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s agricultural loan portfolio (worth  TRY&nbsp;9,039 million) consisted of medium- and long-term investment-finance  loans while the remaining 53% (worth TRY&nbsp;10,369 million) consisted of  short-term working capital loans.</p>
    <p><strong>Başakkart: Practical  financing solutions that make producers&rsquo; lives easier.</strong><br />
      Başakkart is a more than just a bank card that Ziraat Bank  issues to its agricultural sector customers: It&rsquo;s also a financing tool.</p>
    <p>During 2013, 180,000 producers used their Başakkart cards to  borrow TRY&nbsp;2.1 billion worth of an aggregate agricultural credit limit  amounting to TRY&nbsp;2.9 billion. With Başakkart, producers significantly  reduce the burden of financing their production processes by purchasing such  inputs as fuel, seed, fertilizer, pesticides, feed, and veterinary services  from Başakkart merchant partners on interest-free terms of up to five months.</p>

	<p><strong>As a requirement of its  mission, Ziraat Bank continues to supply low-interest agricultural loans.</strong><br />
In May 2013, Ziraat Bank reduced the interest rates on its  agricultural loans, in some cases to the single-digit range. The&nbsp;rate  charged on agricultural loans with terms of one year or less was lowered to 8%  while the rates charged on loans more than one year up to four and on loans  more than four years&rsquo; duration were set at 10% and 11% respectively.</p>
    <p>Under Council of Ministers decrees, the Bank&rsquo;s  agricultural-sector customers found it possible to borrow at rates that varied  between 0% and 8.25% a year when state subsidies provided for specific  production categories are taken into account. In&nbsp;2013, 254,610 producers  and firms operating in the agricultural sector were provided with  reduced-interest loans amounting to TRY&nbsp;9.2 billion.</p>
    <p>In the conduct of its low-interest lending, Ziraat Bank also  provides low-interest loans to firms engaged in organic farming and controlled  under-cover cultivation and/or implementing good agricultural practices with  the aims of protecting and improving natural resources and/or encouraging  environmentally sustainable and high-quality food production. Low-interest  loans are also extended to producers who want to use renewable sources of  energy (such as solar and biomass) in the conduct of their production  activities.</p>
    <p><strong>A financial model that  promotes agroindustry-producer collaboration</strong><br />
      In 2013 Ziraat Bank signed protocols with 18 firms active in the  seed, sugar beet, trout and poultry sectors under which the firms were provided  with an aggregate TRY&nbsp;128 million line of credit to extend to 29,000  contractual producers as operating and investment-finance loans on favorable  terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Continued success of the  interest-free livestock financing loan program</strong><br />
      In August 2010 Ziraat Bank began extending interest-free  livestock financing loans both to meet the needs of customers wishing to  modernize or increase the capacity of existing cattle, sheep, and poultry  breeding and fattening businesses and to support the establishment of new  livestock enterprises. Under this program last year, the Bank supplied 30,886  customers with cash loans amounting in total to TRY&nbsp;579 million. This  performance brings the total number of such customers to 152,100 since the  beginning of the program and the total amount lent to them as interest-free  livestock financing to TRY&nbsp;6.9 billion. </p>
<p><strong>More than 133,000  customers have benefited from fixed-interest tractor finance loans.</strong><br />
In 2013 Ziraat Bank extended TRY&nbsp;1,052 million worth of  fixed-interest tractor finance loans to 25,133 customers. Since the  introduction of this program in 2004, a total of TRY&nbsp;4,294 million has  been lent to 133,937 of the Bank&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<p><strong>More than two billion  worth of greenhouse cultivation financing support in a decade</strong><br />
  Ziraat Bank lent TRY&nbsp;306 million to finance the greenhouse  cultivation activities of 5,327 customers in 2013. Over the last ten years, the  Bank has supplied a total of TRY&nbsp;2.1 billion in loans to 83,559 customers  to finance greenhouse construction, modernization, production, and similar  undertakings.</p>

	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank also creates  value through its efforts to help the agricultural sector protect itself  against the risks to which it is exposed.</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s agricultural insurance activities are conducted  through a sound bancassurance approach that has been developed through its subsidiary,  Ziraat Sigorta.</p>
    <p>2013 was a record-breaking year for agricultural insurance  premium production in Turkey. The&nbsp;number of TARSİM-issued policies  increased by 20% to 891,876 last year while total premium production was up by  6% to TRY&nbsp;526,835,325.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Ziraat Sigorta was once again the country&rsquo;s leading  supplier of agricultural insurance. The&nbsp;50% rise in Ziraat Sigorta&rsquo;s  premium production, largely for crop coverage, was the biggest contributor to  the agricultural insurance business line&rsquo;s growth. Ziraat Sigorta by itself accounted  for 45% of TARSİM&rsquo;s premium production last year.</p>
    <p class="hilite">A significant proportion of the financing that Ziraat Bank  provides to the agricultural sector consists of loans to micro-scale,  family-owned businesses. When considered in the context of the social impact of  product and services of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s, offerings, this is clear-cut evidence of  the contributions that the Bank makes to improving welfare and increasing  employment in rural areas.</p>
    <p class="hilite">Ziraat Bank will continue to provide multidimensional  support to agriculture and thus contribute to its growth and development.</p>
<p class="hilitegri">Ziraat Bank is committed to playing a leading and stakeholding role in order to support real-sector projects both in Turkey and abroad.</p>

	<p class="title2">PROJECT FINANCE ACTIVITIES AND SUSTAINABILITY AT ZİRAAT BANK</p>
    <p>The contributions that Ziraat Bank makes to economic development  are also to be seen in the project finance business line.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank once again played an active role in  financing projects in many different sectors so long as they effectively  contribute to the national economy, create high added value, and are capable of  generating their own revenue streams.</p>
    <p>In the projects that Ziraat Bank financed in 2013, careful  attention was given not just to their contributions to Turkey&rsquo;s economic  development but also to their environmental and social benefits as well.  Examples of such undertakings include projects that call for recycling and  recovering waste paper to make it economically useful, highway projects that  improve transportation by shortening distances and thus conserve fuel,  financing projects that enhance local producers&rsquo; ability to compete, renewable  energy projects, projects to prevent illegal tapping of the electrical power  grid, and projects to increase local employment through the creation of new  production opportunities.</p>
    <p>The Bank is committed to playing a leading and stakeholding role  in order to support <br />
      real-sector projects both in Turkey and abroad.</p>
	<p style="float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;"><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/Raporlar/2013/images/p/24491125_xl.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
	<p><strong>The importance of  environmental and social risk assessment</strong><br />
In the conduct of its project finance activities, Ziraat Bank  draws up project-specific lending agreements and has assessments performed of  the social and environmental risks that a project entails.</p>
    <p>For every project, a preliminary study is carried out to  determine if the project needs an environmental impact assessment (EIA).  The&nbsp;lending process may not proceed unless an &ldquo;EIA Favorable&rdquo; or &ldquo;EIA Not  Required&rdquo; decision is reached. In&nbsp;the case of projects fraught with severe  environmental risks, an &ldquo;environmental consultant&rdquo; must be designated even if a  favorable report has been issued.</p>
    <p>During the construction and operation stages, the independent  technical consultant and the environmental consultant responsible for the  project may be requested to submit reports at prescribed intervals if such are  deemed to be necessary. These reports make it possible for the Bank to keep  track of project firms&rsquo; compliance with the environmental and social conditions  set out in the lending agreement.</p>
    <p>Depending on the nature and location of an investment as well as  other considerations, investor firms may be required to obtain appropriate  licenses from the Cultural Heritage Protection Authority in order to help  prevent activities that may be detrimental to historical monuments etc. During  the investment phase, construction firms are required to supply proof that they  have obtained necessary building licenses from local municipal authorities for  approved projects. This rule supports efforts to ensure that construction takes  place in compliance with laws and regulations and to keep building activities  from causing environmental harm.</p>
    <p>Investment monitoring reports are issued detailing the progress  of projects and investments being undertaken by firms that have borrowed from  Ziraat Bank. In&nbsp;this process, the Bank keeps track of projects not just as  a lender but rather as a partner in the investment.</p>
    <p>In the conduct of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s project finance operations in  2013, the social/environmental risks of four of fourteen projects with a total  risk exposure of USD&nbsp;1.6 billion were subjected to regular auditing and  reporting by an environment consultant. Based on the results of such auditing,  no project was found to be in breach of its lending agreement terms.</p>
    <p>Loans that are extended in collaboration with the World Bank are  periodically subjected to environmental documentation audits as well as to  financial audits. While such audits are performed by randomly sampling records,  World Bank officers also have the right to visit and inspect projects. During  2013, no project being financed with World Bank credit was visited or inspected  by any World Bank officer.</p>
    <p>Similarly during the reporting period, no project financed with  European Investment Bank or European Investment Fund credit was subjected to  any environmental audit by any of their officers.</p>

<div class="dartext">
	<p><strong>Project finance and human  health</strong><br />
The project finance agreements that Ziraat Bank enters into may  also contain clauses pertaining to the prevention of activities that are  detrimental to human health.</p>
    <p>In 2013, the contracts governing 12 of 26 currently active  projects (corresponding to 46% of the total) contained clauses pertaining to  the protection of human health. In&nbsp;four projects, there were also clauses  calling for the inclusion of a social-impact study in the environmental  consultant&rsquo;s report.</p>
    <p><strong>World Bank investment  project social-impact control mechanisms</strong><br />
      Although there are no projects specifically subject to human  rights auditing that are covered by lending agreements with international  thematic funds, World Bank-funded investment projects do include social-impact  control mechanisms that are integrated into their environmental-impact control  mechanisms.</p>
    <p>For an investment that is to be financed by Ziraat Bank with  World Bank-supplied funding, an environmental management plan must be prepared  and people in the project&rsquo;s locality must be informed of this by means of  public meetings. In&nbsp;addition, care is given so that projects being  financed do not lead to unnecessary displacement and projects are not financed  if they make it necessary for a significant number of people to be  involuntarily resettled.</p>
    <p><strong>Agricultural loans and  manufacturing firms</strong><br />
      When evaluating agricultural projects, points are given for the  inclusion of good agricultural practices and for adherence to organic farming  criteria and practices. The&nbsp;inclusion of such practices impacts favorably  on a customer&rsquo;s risk rating.</p>
    <p>In the case of manufacturing firms and the compliance of their  production facilities, the absence of apparatus such as ecological  purification, flue filtration, and similar systems in sectors where such  equipment is deemed necessary or whose use is legally mandated earns a facility  a &ldquo;Poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Very Poor&rdquo; score and adversely impacts a firm&rsquo;s overall rating.</p>
    <p class="title2">THE VALUE CREATED FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS</p>
    <p>Public agencies and organizations represent an important and  natural customer base for Ziraat Bank.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Ankara Public Corporate Branch was put  into service in order to provide a sound and effective basis for the service  relationship between the Bank and public agencies and organizations.  The&nbsp;Bank intends to increase the number of such branches and also plans to  open &ldquo;public enterprise branches&rdquo; before the end of 2014. Another Ziraat Bank  objective is to provide firms that supply the public sector  with  increasingly more financial services. The&nbsp;Bank anticipates intensifying  its marketing efforts in this direction in 2014.</p>
    <p><strong>Ziraat Bank is the main  distribution channel for state support payments in Turkey.</strong><br />
      Every year Ziraat Bank processes tens of millions of support  payments made by a host of public agencies and organizations. In&nbsp;that  capacity, it serves as the main distribution channel in the management of state  social policy.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank successfully handled the following payments  on behalf of public authorities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Agricultural Support Payments </li>
      <li>Housing Benefit Payments </li>
      <li>Employee Savings Incentive Payments </li>
      <li>Protocol-Based Payments &amp; Collections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These activities are summarized briefly below.</p>
    <p><strong>Agricultural Support  Payments</strong><br />
      Last year Ziraat Bank continued to process agricultural support  payments as required by laws, regulations, and administrative communiques.  In&nbsp;2013 the Bank handled a 4,282,811 payments amounting to TRY&nbsp;8,132  million in total.</p>
	<p><strong>Housing Benefit Payments</strong><br />
Under Statute 5664 (Act concerning the payment of housing  benefits to those entitled to them) dated 22&nbsp;May 2007 and Regulation 26613  dated 14&nbsp;August 2007, Ziraat Bank is charged with handling payments made  under a protocol which the Bank has entered into with Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul  Yatırım Ortaklığı A.Ş. (EGYO), a semi-privatized property &amp; housing real  estate investment trust. The&nbsp;Bank continues to make payments as instructed  by EGYO. In&nbsp;2013 Ziraat Bank made 55,993 payments amounting to  TRY&nbsp;16.5 million in total to such beneficiaries.-</p>
    <p><strong>Employee Savings  Incentive Payments</strong><br />
      Ziraat Bank processes Employee Savings Incentive Program  payments and collections on behalf of the Treasury pursuant to principles and  procedures set forth in applicable laws and regulations. In&nbsp;2013 the Bank  made payments amounting to TRY&nbsp;316.5 thousand in total to 383 such  beneficiaries.-</p>
    <p><strong>Protocol-Based Payments  &amp; Collections</strong><br />
      Ziraat Bank provides public agencies and organizations with  payment and collection processing services under protocol agreements that it  enters into with them. In&nbsp;2013 the Bank processed 127,030,776 such  transactions amounting to TRY&nbsp;167,419 million in total.</p>
    <p class="title2">ZİRAAT BANK: TURKEY&rsquo;S CUSTOMER-FOCUSED BANK</p>
    <p>For the first time in 2013 the Banking Regulation and  Supervision Agency (BDDK) included &ldquo;customer focus&rdquo; along with &ldquo;retail customer  service: and &ldquo;financial consumer protection&rdquo; among the categories of criteria  according to which it audits the Turkish banking industry.</p>
    <p>Under the Customer-Focused Audit model (MOD) that BDDK has  developed for this purpose, retail banking products and services are examined  and rated on the basis of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparency and customer awareness,</li>
      <li>Fairness of pricing principles,</li>
      <li>Responsibility (Customer relationship management quality),</li>
      <li>Consumer perception.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When introduced as a pilot project, BDDK checked the performance  of banks supplying 95% of the sector&rsquo;s retail banking services against these  criteria and assigned them &ldquo;MOD points&rdquo;. Ziraat Bank ranked first among all the  Banks so audited by earning the greatest number of points.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing value to  customers: Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s New Generation Online Branch opened for service in  2013.</strong><br />

With its information architecture, infrastructure, design and  new-generation information technology, the Ziraat Bank Online Branch&rsquo;s new  features and its simplified, practical layout make it as enjoyable to use as it  is easy.</p>
<p>The goal of the Ziraat Bank New Generation Online Branch is to  allow customers to take care of their banking business more effectively: newly-added  screens give customers convenient access to the information and transactions  they want while a &ldquo;smart calendar&rdquo; module lets them set reminders for  themselves on dates in the future.</p>
<p>With its easily-accessible menu of actions categorized according  to needs and with its user-friendly look, the Ziraat Bank New Generation Online  Branch seeks to exceed customers&rsquo; expectations. Owing to its streamlined  design, the branch is just as functional on mobile devices as it is on  computers, making it usable wherever and whenever a customer needs to.</p>

<div class="dartext">
	<p><strong>Thanks in part to the  launch of the New Generation Online Branch, the number of Ziraat Bank online  banking customers increased by 50% in 2013.</strong><br />
In the twelve months to end-2013, the number of customers  registered to enter the Ziraat Bank online branch grew by 50% and reached 2.7  million. Paralleling this growth, the number of financial transactions  performed increased by 12.9% from 31 million to 35 million over the same period  while the total value of such transactions grew by 51.5% to TRY&nbsp;90.9  billion.</p>
    <p><strong>Enhancing value to  customers: Delivering even better service to customers with disabilities</strong><br />
      In keeping with its customer-focused service approach, offering  banking products and services in formats that are convenient for customers with  disabilities to use is an important priority for Ziraat Bank.</p>
    <p>The entrances to the great majority of Ziraat Bank branches are  designed to make them usable by customers with orthopedic disabilities. Work is  currently in progress to give such customers more convenient access to the  Bank&rsquo;s branch, ATM, and online banking services. Under a pilot project that is  currently under way, a number of branches and ATM units are being redesigned so  as to make them even more usable. The&nbsp;Bank plans to extend these changes  to other locations based on the results of this project. Under another project,  revisions are to be made that will allow visually-impaired customers to benefit  from Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s services too.</p>
    <p>The Ziraat Bank online branch was designed to be usable by those  who are visually-impaired. Work is currently in progress to make changes in the  Bank&rsquo;s mobile banking applications so that they too may better serve the needs  of such users.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing value to  customers: 150 new branches in 150<sup>th</sup> year</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank opened more new branches–150 in all–than any other  bank in Turkey last year.</p>
<p>In 2013 all processes related to branch openings, closures, and  relocations were integrated into Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s electronic task flows. This not  only reduced the operational workloads involved but also further improved  objective decision-making through integration with Geographical Information  Systems.</p>
<p>In 2011 Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s network consisted of 1,434 branches; as of  end-2013 there were 1,636. During the same, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s share of the total  number of branches in the Turkish banking system increased to 15.0%.</p>
<p>This growth in branch numbers not only brings the Bank closer to  customers but also helps reduce the environmental pollution that would result  in customers having to use transportation to come to a branch.</p>
<p>The wide coverage of the Bank&rsquo;s extensive ATM network also  brings it closer to customers. At end-2013, 12.7% of the ATM units operating in  Turkey belonged to Ziraat Bank.</p>
<p class="title2">FINANCIAL LITERACY</p>
<p class="kirmizi">In today&rsquo;s world, well-educated people are what enable their  societies to stand out and compete. As part of the process of increasing  financial affluence, financial literacy is of great importance to Turkey&rsquo;s  development and progress vision because it helps make consumers of financial  products and services better aware of their nature and underlying concepts and  thus able to make informed choices about risks and alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>The proper management of  material resources is as crucial to societies&rsquo; future as it is to individuals&rsquo;.</strong><br />
  Knowledge not only underlies economic empowerment but also  brings with it economic strength and self-confidence. Financial literacy is  valuable because it nourishes the propensity for long-term saving and generates  the essential national resources needed to finance investments.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank believes in the need for financial literacy, which  is to say in the need to improve people&rsquo;s ability to make informed decisions,  and it therefore engages in systematic efforts in that direction. Beginning  with making certain that a customer has proper access to correct information  about the Bank&rsquo;s products and services through every channel, such efforts  embrace a wide range of activities that include financial-themed meetings and  information workshops with focus groups. Members of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s senior  management also appear as speakers at many events while interviews given to  newspapers and magazines provide opportunities to communicate messages that  will contribute to financial literacy among a wider audience.</p>

Marketing communication helps improve an  advertiser&rsquo;s effectiveness both nationally and internationally while also  providing tangible benefits to consumers, firms, and the public at large.</p>
<p>Taking this awareness as its point of departure, Ziraat Bank  seeks first of all to ensure that all of its marketing communication and  promotional activities inform customers correctly.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s marketing communication policy is based on the  following principles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising must be lawful and also compatible with the rules of  competition</li>
  <li>All marketing communication must be prepared with an awareness  of social and professional responsibilities and it must be conducted within the  framework of principles of fair competition that </li>
  <li>are generally accepted by the business community.</li>
  <li>Marketing communication must contain no messages or any verbal  or visual elements that are incompatible with a country&rsquo;s or a culture&rsquo;s  generally-accepted public morality.</li>
  <li>Marketing communication must be designed so as not to abuse  customers&rsquo; trust or to exploit their lack of knowledge or experience.</li>
  <li>Messages capable of influencing customers&rsquo; purchasing decisions  about products and services must be truthful, must not be misleading, and must  be communicated at times and in ways that allow them to be understood by  customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ziraat Bank regards sponsorships as a means of communicating  with the public and therefore engages in such projects systematically.</p>
<p>Celebrating Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary, 2013 was  a busy year for the Bank from the standpoint of marketing communication.</p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s products and services were promoted through a  diversified lineup of communication channels such as TV, radio, cinema,  newspapers, magazines, and the internet. A wide variety of activities were also  conducted on the occasion of the Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> year in business.  For further details please see page 52 of this report.</p>
