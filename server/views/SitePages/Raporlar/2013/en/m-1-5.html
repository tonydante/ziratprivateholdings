<div class="dartext">

  <p class="hilite"><strong>Esteemed stakeholders,</strong></p>
  <p class="hilite">It was with both excitement and pride that, in 2013, Ziraat Bank  joined with its stakeholders and celebrated the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of  its founding. 2013 was also a year of change in which we continued to take  decisive and courageous steps that are crucial to our Bank&rsquo;s sustainable  future. The&nbsp;Change and Transformation Project that we are conducting  intensively with the dedicated efforts of our entire team reached an important  stage as the makeover that seeks to set us fully equipped and strongly  positioned in global competition began to take hold.</p>
<p>To the more than a  hundred projects that we had initiated with our &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Together, Toward the Target&rdquo; slogans, we added our global transformation  project in 2014. The&nbsp;keys to our sustainable future summed up in the  expression &ldquo;Together, Further Ahead&rdquo; have begun to have an enduring impact on  our corporate structure and culture.</p>
<p>One of the most  comprehensive restructuring projects ever undertaken in the Turkish banking  industry, the Ziraat Bank Change and Transformation Project is essentially a  corporate sustainability project whose aim is to develop our added-value  generation strengths.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s sustainability policy and approach</strong> <br />
  Reinterpreting  sustainability in all of its aspects, in 2014 our Bank formulated and announced  a Sustainability Policy in light of the realities of our own day.</p>
<p>As a consequence of our  Sustainability Policy, we are focused on extending sustainability, on  developing it, and on making it viable throughout our entire value-creation  chain.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank has defined  its Sustainability Vision as &ldquo;To use the unrivaled experience and knowledge  that we have built up over a century and a half for the benefit of the economy,  the environment, and the community; to produce enduring value for our  stakeholders; to be a globally-competitive bank through the principles of  sustainable profitability and productivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the corporate  sustainability practices that it will be introducing under its Sustainability  Policy, our Bank seeks to further increase the medium- and long-term leveraging  effects created by the Change and Transformation Project. As a consequence of  our Sustainability Approach, we are focused on decisively managing our  responsibilities in balance with our obligations to the environment and the  community. This in turn requires that we engage in a frank, sincere, and  continuous dialogue with all of our stakeholders, including our employees.</p>
<p>We will continue to  develop and carry out projects seeking to integrate universally accepted  sustainability principles into our business model. To that end, our goal is to  play an active role in sustainability initiatives at the national and the  international levels. We regard collaborating with our stakeholders as an  opportunity to increase both our own sustainability capacity as well as  sustainability awareness throughout society.</p>
<p>As a natural leader of  its sector, Ziraat Bank is committed to playing an active role in shaping the  future and to setting new standards for sustainability. It already possesses  vast knowledge and experience on this issue that it can share on international  platforms. At the same time, we believe that the steps that Ziraat Bank itself  takes in the area of corporate sustainability will also encourage many  companies in different sectors in our country to do the same and that we can  guide them in their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability in three stages</strong><br />
  We have devised a  three-stage plan to take advantage of the leveraging effects that corporate  sustainability has on growth. In&nbsp;the first stage, which is the one  currently in progress, we have acknowledged compliance with sustainability  standards as a factor supporting growth initiatives under our Change and  Transformation Project. In&nbsp;addition to the economic sustainability of  which we have been mindful since 2012 with the announcement of our  Sustainability Policy, we are also continuing our efforts to embrace and  improve awareness of sustainability&rsquo;s environmental and social dimensions as  well.</p>
<p>In the second stage, we  will embark upon the process of an in-depth internalization of sustainability  throughout the Ziraat Bank value-creation chain. All our efforts in this second  stage will have two focal points in common: one will be concerned with making  increasingly greater use of sustainability criteria in improving effectiveness  and productivity in the Bank&rsquo;s service processes, the other with supporting the  propagation of sustainability awareness among customers and all of our other  stakeholders. The&nbsp;final stage will consist of an ongoing synthesis in  which sustainability is extended, developed, and made viable throughout the  entire Ziraat Finance Group. As it completes its global transformation in this  third stage, Ziraat Bank will emerge is an integrated service provider capable  of taking on its competitors and advancing its presence on every front at the  global level.</p>
<p>These three stages of  sustainability are in fact a single interlocking, never-ending cycle. What will  be important here is the determination, the transparency, the engagement, and  the performance that we demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong> <br />
  Corporate sustainability  practices present us with important opportunities, foremost among which are the  contributions they will make to Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s global competitive strength.  Compliance with current international standards will add value on a wide range  of fronts from international funding costs to investor relations and it will  also reinforce our group&rsquo;s strength. Another opportunity lying before us is  that, thanks to economies of scale, the sustainability projects that we  undertake throughout the group will enable us to create much more extensive and  enduring value and to share that value with our stakeholders. We regard the  employee participation and voluntarism that we expect will be nourished by  sustainability practices as yet another opportunity. The&nbsp;development of  social responsibility projects that will encourage employee participation and  voluntarism will not only strengthen Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s stance as a role model but  will also strengthen our human resources&rsquo; sense of identification with the  Bank.</p>
<p>The period ahead of us  holds out as much the prospect of competition and risk as it does that of  opportunity. As one outcome of rising expectations and stakeholders&rsquo;  rapidly-evolving demands with respect to environmental issues, we regard  corporate sustainability as a matter in which there will be competition in all  business lines.</p>
<p><strong>For a sustainable future</strong> <br />
  As it advances towards  its goal of being a customer-focused, competitive, strong, high-market-value,  and world-integrated bank, Ziraat Bank regards the priorities of a changing and  developing world as its own priorities.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank is a strong  and deep-rooted institution with the capacity to properly perceive and  interpret sustainability. Our Bank is determined to be a role model and to  author best practices by using its strength to foresee trends in markets and  competition and to approach and respond to them appropriately. Furthermore as a  responsible corporate citizen, Ziraat Bank will also continue its efforts to  ensure that sustainability remains just as important a consideration when  dealing with environmental and social issues in the future as in the past.</p>
<p>If there are to be  sustainable tomorrows then there need to be cooperation, leadership, and action  today. In&nbsp;this process, Ziraat Bank will continue to perform the duties  incumbent upon it, just as it has always done.</p>
<p>It gives us pleasure to  be sharing with you in the form of our first sustainability report, not only  the enduring value that we have created as a product of the boundless efforts  and exertions of our employees in the course of a century and a half but also  our goals for the future.</p>
<p>Thank you for your  contributions, your support, and your consideration.</p>
<p>Very  truly yours,</p>
