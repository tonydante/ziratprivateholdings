<div class="dartext">
	<p class="hilite">Ziraat Bank’s sustainability objective is, through the corporate sustainable practices that it introduces in line with its Sustainability Policy, to further enhance both the Bank’s strong position in its home market and its global competitive strength by increasing the leverage effects of its Change &amp; Transformation Project in the medium and long term first at Ziraat Bank and then throughout all of its subsidiaries.</p>
	<p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank  completed the infrastructure transformation projects that it initiated in 2012  under the slogan &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo; with the aim of taking the  unrivaled store of knowledge and experience that it has built up in the course  of its corporate history into the future. The&nbsp;fundamental goal of the  Change &amp; Transformation Project is to grow while remaining sustainably  profitable and productive. </p>
    <p>However change and  transformation are never-ending journey. In&nbsp;order to take the successes  achieved under this project to the next level, in 2013 Ziraat Bank continued  its corporate development projects under the slogan &ldquo;Together, Toward the  Target&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Carried out with the  same excitement and with a dynamic approach at Ziraat Bank itself and among its  international subsidiaries, these projects were again financed out of the  Bank&rsquo;s internal resources in 2013, just as they were in 2012.</p>
    <p>Each one unique but  conducted in coordination with one another, there are more than a hundred such  projects. They are organized into 27 primary project groups and rooted in six  fundamental principles.</p>
    <p><strong>1. One-On-One Customer Relationship Management</strong><br />
      Customers are among  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s most precious assets. Establishing a sustainable,  added-value-creating relationship with each customer is one of the Bank&rsquo;s most  important objectives.</p>
    <p>The principle of  changing from a Product/Customer-Based Approach&rdquo; to a &ldquo;Bank Customer-Based  Approach&rdquo; that was identified in 2012 was taken to the next level in 2013 by  replacing the concept of &ldquo;bank customer&rdquo; with that of &ldquo;Ziraat customer&rdquo;. Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s infrastructure was further developed in 2013 both structurally and  systematically so as to better listen to and understand customers&rsquo; financial  needs and to address them correctly.</p>
    <p>Seeking to be a strong  player in global markets in line with the Change &amp; Transformation Project,  Ziraat Bank is committed both to pursuing its ambition to author best practices  in customer relationship management.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Institutionalized Appetite for Risk</strong><br />
      The fundamental criteria  to which Ziraat Bank adheres for the effective management of credit risk  consist of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring that dynamic lending policies are properly communicated  to those working in the field</li>
      <li>Fostering a shared credit culture</li>
      <li>Proactively monitoring credit risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The decision support  systems that were put in place in 2012 continued to be improved with the  addition of new features in 2013. New practices concerning effective loan  monitoring and collections were also introduced.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Effective Information Technology and Operational Infrastructure</strong><br />
      2013 was a year in which  Ziraat Bank brought to completion a number of major infrastructure projects.  Efforts to expand the scope of automation in branches, regional departments,  and headquarters units continued with no loss of momentum. In&nbsp;line with  this, IT infrastructure and IT hardware replacements initiated to make more  effective use of technology also continued, IT equipment that had reached the  end of its service life was replaced, and local area network and IP PBX projects  also neared completion.</p>
    <p>One of the most  important of the Bank&rsquo;s goals in 2013 was to turn its branches into places that  focus on customers&rsquo; financial needs while also reducing branch workloads. To  achieve this, the set of transactions performed directly by the Operations  Center (which opened in 2012) was expanded as were efforts to manage branches&rsquo;  operational workloads. Process centralization and system improvements carried  out in 2012 and 2013 made it possible for 2,207 members of the Bank&rsquo;s workforce  to focus their attentions on addressing customers&rsquo; needs.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Objective and Transparent Human Resources Management</strong><br />
      Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Human  Resources Policy is informed by a structure that places people at its center.  An important element of this policy is that employees should benefit from the  job satisfaction that arises from working happily in positions befitting their  abilities.</p>
    <p>In 2012 Ziraat Bank  changed from a title-based, largely vertical organizational structure to a more  horizontal structure based on job descriptions. This process continued in 2013  with the introduction of practices enabling employees to advance in their job  positions according to their abilities and competencies and also to be promoted  based on their testing performance.</p>
    <p>In this way about half  of all employees advanced to the next higher level/position. The&nbsp;purview  of the Individual Performance Evaluation System, which evaluates employees on  the basis of their performance, was expanded to include branch personnel as  well in 2013.</p>
    <p>As required by Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s principle of transparency, employees are involved in and made aware of  all innovations in issues affected by the Change &amp; Transformation Project.  In&nbsp;2012 a variety of in-house communication channels were opened in order  to keep personnel informed about changes being made under that project.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Robust Equity Resources</strong><br />
      Profits, which are the  most important element of a company&rsquo;s equity, are retained by Ziraat Bank as a  way of further strengthening the Bank&rsquo;s equity resources. In&nbsp;keeping with  the principle that rational bigness is better than just bigness, Ziraat Bank  seeks to achieve sustainable profitability and growth and in 2013 it continued  its efforts to do so. In&nbsp;order to be a bank that creates adds more value  to the national economy by financing the real sector, Ziraat Bank reduced the  share of its balance-sheet assets consisting of real estate properties while  also increasing both the share of loans and the percentage of deposits being  lent out. Efforts were made to diversify non-deposit resources in order to  lower the Bank&rsquo;s liability costs. This included having recourse to syndicated  loans and to bank bond and bill issuances.</p>
<p><strong>6. Integrated Subsidiary &amp; Affiliate Management</strong><br />
An important goal for  Ziraat Bank in 2013, summed up in the change of focus from one of &ldquo;Bank  Customer&rdquo; to one of &ldquo;Ziraat Customer&rdquo;, was to ensure that all of its customers&rsquo;  financial needs can be addressed entirely from within the Ziraat Finance Group.</p>
<p>Since the second quarter  of 2013, the Bank has been carrying out projects aimed at expanding the  organizational capabilities of its subsidiaries and international branches.</p>
<p>The projects being  undertaken as part of the changeover to a Ziraat Customer Business Model are  concerned with such issues as organizational structure revisions, customer  &amp; branch segmentation, credit evaluation model design, improvements in HR  practices, basic banking software and application upgrades, and process  management. The&nbsp;goal is to bring about the Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s global  transformation by completing all of these projects before the end of 2014.</p>

<p class="title2">Ziraat Bank’s Sustainability Policy<sup>3</sup></p>
	<p><strong>Our sustainability vision</strong><br />
To use the unrivaled  experience and knowledge that we have built up over a century and a half for  the benefit of the economy, the environment, and the community; to produce  enduring value for our stakeholders; to be a globally-competitive bank through  the principles of sustainable profitability and efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Our sustainability goal</strong><br />
      To further develop both  the Bank&rsquo;s strong position in the domestic market and its global competitive  strength by increasing the medium- and long-term leverage effect of the Change  and Transformation Project through corporate sustainability practices to be  implemented under this Sustainability Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Our sustainability approach</strong><br />
      Our sustainability  approach is shaped in light of our responsibilities as a financial services  provider, of our obligations to the environment and the community, and of our  duties as an employer.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>We regard environmental sustainability–including climate change  and the transition to a low-carbon economy–as an important item on our agenda.</li>
      <li>As an employer, we believe in the importance of humane working  conditions. In&nbsp;our business model we give importance to equality of  opportunity among all of our employees: we regard diversity in our workforce as  a component of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s richness and therefore we support it.</li>
      <li>As a service provider, we regard customer focus and customer  satisfaction as being fundamental to everything. Our goal is to offer banking  products and services to all of our customers in formats that are practical,  intelligible, and accessible and also to enrich the banking industry through  innovative and exemplary practices.</li>
      <li>As a business partner, our relationships with suppliers are  grounded in the principles of mutual respect, responsibility, and fairness and  we are committed to developing them accordingly. We support our suppliers&rsquo;  success through cooperative projects that we carry out together.</li>
      <li>We are committed to continuously developing and implementing  projects whose aim is to integrate universally-accepted sustainability  principles into our business model.</li>
      <li>We attach importance to having a presence and playing an active  role in multilateral sustainability initiatives and collaboration platforms at  both the national and international levels.</li>

  <li>We engage with our customers on a variety of collaboration and  awareness platforms. We regard efforts to increase financial literacy and  awareness of sustainability as an essential part of our social responsibility.</li>
  <li>Developing mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers  is another of our priorities. We regard it as important that our suppliers  recognize and abide by universally-accepted sustainability principles and we  accordingly encourage them to do so.</li>
  <li>We believe in mutually frank and respectful communication with  our stakeholders. In&nbsp;stakeholder communication, we focus on the  transparent disclosure of our progress on environmental and social matters as  well as of our economic performance.</li>
  <li>We believe that the success of corporate sustainability  practices will enhance the Bank&rsquo;s sustainability index performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank and the environment</strong><br />
  As one of the biggest  employers in the Turkish banking industry and the hub of its most extensive  physical service network, our goals are to curb our direct and indirect  environmental impact, to effectively manage that impact by means of appropriate  strategies and technologies, and to constantly improve our performance in this  direction.

  <li>We regard it as important that our customers and suppliers have  a greater awareness of environmental issues and we encourage them to make a  greater effort for the sake of environmental sustainability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Concerning stakeholder dialogue…</strong></p>
<p>During 2013, the general  manager and other Ziraat Bank representatives appeared on television and  contributed to and/or were interviewed by publications on matters related to  economic issues. They also took part in a variety of economy-, trade-,  development-, and energy-related conferences held in Turkey and other  countries.</p>
<p>During August and September  2012, bank officers and representatives met with more than 100 customers in the  context of focus groups and in-depth interviews. The&nbsp;objective of such  activities was to gain an understanding of the Ziraat Bank customer experience  and to consider the degree to which customers are satisfied with the service  they get from the Bank. </p>
<p>Through these contacts  it was ascertained that Ziraat Bank is seen as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A bank that inspires confidence,</li>
  <li>A &ldquo;people&rsquo;s bank&rdquo; and</li>
  <li>A  bank that stands by its customers.</li>

<p class="title2">Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s sustainability priorities</p>
