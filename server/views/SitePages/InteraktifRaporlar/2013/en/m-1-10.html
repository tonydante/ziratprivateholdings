<p>Ziraat Bank has set its  financial management strategy as: </p>
<ul>
	<li>holding shareholders equity that is aligned with the size of the  balance sheet, </li>
	<li>increasing the  relative  share of  loans,      </li>
	<li>attaining an effective and diversified funding resource base.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank applied an  extensive change and transformation project with a view to fulfilling the  financial needs of its customers through the right channels, at the right time,  and with the right value propositions. Through this change and transformation  project, the Bank intends to achieve increased efficiency and productivity in  its customer relationships, its lending processes and in its policies.<br />
	Molding its activities in  a manner which ensures a well-balanced balance sheet structure, Ziraat Bank had  TL&nbsp;207.5 billion of total assets at the end of 2013. Working with its  target of ensuring sustainable profitability - an important component of  shareholders’ equity - the Bank posted a year-end net profit of TL&nbsp;3,330  million, an increase of 26% YoY.</p>
<p>The Bank notched up a  considerable increase in profitability and productivity ratios, which are the  key success indicators for the Bank. The&nbsp;return on equity (RoE) increased  from 17.6% in 2012 to 18.5% in 2013. Likewise, the return on assets (RoA) also  increased from 1.7% in 2012 to 1.8% in 2013.</p>
<p>Total lending, which stood  at TL&nbsp;71 billion at the end of 2012, increased by 55% YoY to TL&nbsp;111  billion in 2013.
	The Bank’s total deposits  amounted to TL&nbsp;142 billion at the end of 2013, marking an increase of 19%  YoY, and the share of deposits in total liabilities was 68%. Savings deposits  accounted for the largest portion of deposits, with a 44% share.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding the domestic service network</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank, which  provides services to almost every point in Turkey, structured its widespread  branch network in line with the Bank’s customer definition and new business  model strategies. The&nbsp;Bank took significant steps towards providing an  effective service to customers as well as the most optimal working environment  for its employees. The&nbsp;Bank opened 150 new branches in 2013, its 150<sup>th</sup>  anniversary year, and continued to single handedly fulfill the banking needs of  its customers at 400 locations in Turkey.</p>
<p>The renewed website  serves as a good example of the ongoing investments undertaken for the purpose  of developing external-branch channels. Efforts were stepped up with the aim of  delivering effective banking to a larger audience.</p>
<p><strong>At the end of 2013, the Bank had a total of 1,636 domestic  branches, including the 5 corporate branches, 27 commercial branches and 81  entrepreneurial branches - in addition to the 1,521 bank branches and two  mobile branches.</strong></p>
<p>Within the scope of its  efforts to expand its domestic branch network, Ziraat Bank will continue to  open new branches in the future, with a particular focus on Istanbul and  districts where no other bank is present, and continue to contribute to the  country’s employment.<strong> </strong><br />
	. <br />
	<strong>Restructuring process in the scope of the new business model</strong><br />
	Under the scope of the  new customer focused business model, Ziraat Bank continues to meet the banking  services and product needs of its corporate and individual customers at the  right point, the right time and with the most appropriate conditions.</p>
<p>In 2013 the Bank  initiated multiple projects in line with its redefined business model, customer  segmentation, and the organization of its domestic and overseas subsidiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Decision Making Module</strong><br />
	The Individual Decision  Making Module came in to effect to be applied at all branches on 25&nbsp;March  2013, with the aim of facilitating objective loan allowance decisions through a  rating system, that will enable the measurement of risk, enabling all  departments to be aware of the Bank’s risk appetite of the Bank. </p>
<p><strong>Credit Evaluation Modules</strong><br />
Credit Evaluation  Modules, constructed through Finart IT systems structure, assist in the  measurement of credibility of corporations applying for a loan. </p>
<p>SME and enterprise  analysis reports prepared using the system will help to;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create an appropriate executive credit risk management  environment,</li>
	<li>Ensure effective monitoring, credit risk measurement and credit  evaluation, and a sound decision-making process,</li>
	<li>Apply an early warning mechanism in the risk control and  portfolio management processes,</li>
	<li>Set up a credit management IT system for effective auditing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aforementioned modules  entered effect throughout the Bank in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Project to Revise the Credit Process </strong><br />
	In the project, the  processes of extending loans, collections and the use of credit monitors was  revised and updated in order to speed up processes and increase efficiency.  This also brought time savings in the branches and collection departments. </p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Başak Model&rdquo; Evaluation Methodology</strong><br />
	The Başak Model is used  to evaluate loan needs of unlimited companies with up to TL&nbsp;50,000 in  capital and which are active in agricultural sector. </p>
<p>Evaluations are conducted  by using information connected to customers which is available on the system  and criteria dependent on the sectors in which they operate. Sector criteria  are rated by the system automatically facilitating a more simplified conclusion  of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>The evaluation system  enabled the more rapid finalization of application procedures for agricultural  producers applying for loans of up to TL&nbsp;50,000 - which total 70% of the  whole agricultural sector portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank, celebrating its 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary in  2013, is moving forward step by step towards realizing its targets with the  dynamism brought about by its restructuring, and is striving unwaveringly to  gain the corporate structure needed in today&rsquo;s modern banking.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Loans obtained from international finance corporations</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank cooperates  with national and international corporations to provide more appropriate  low-cost and long-maturity investment credit and to help finance the working  capital requirements of SMEs and medium sized enterprises, which make up an  important portion of Turkey’s commercial and industrial operations.

<p>The third agreement in  the project to provide SMEs with access to financing was signed in August 2013.  A USD&nbsp;300 million long-term loan was made available, to be used by SMEs  through leasing companies and banks which hold a leasing license.</p>
<p>Under the scope of this  credit channel, all investments undertaken by SMEs will be financed, thus  ensuring a contribution to the development of the national economy. Moreover,  the leasing sector also has the opportunity to access medium and long term  funding.</p>

The&nbsp;loans extended in this framework are intended to  fund investments that SMEs will undertake in Turkey, eliminate regional  differences and to meet SME&rsquo;s needs for operating capital in an effort to  support the growth of SMEs by increasing their production, productivity and  employment.</p>
<p>As a result of the high  success ratio in the project, a new EUR&nbsp;200 million loan was approved by  the European Investment Bank. The&nbsp;agreement for the first EUR&nbsp;100  million installment was signed in September 2013 and this resource was made available  for the use of customers. The&nbsp;remainder will be accessible after  completion of the first part of the project. In&nbsp;an extension of the  previous project, medium sized enterprises may also access this loan. </p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;My First Business, My First Bank&rdquo; loan collateralized by the  European Investment Fund</strong><br />
	A guarantee agreement  incorporating collateral for the cash loan volume of TL&nbsp;300 million was  signed by the Bank and the European Investment Fund (EIF) in 2011 to finance  the operations of SMEs at attractive costs without imposing the burden of  additional collateral for their access to funds. The&nbsp;project&rsquo;s success led  to an extension of project, to TL&nbsp;1.3 billion, and this amount has been  put in use. <br />
	Under the agreement, the  EIB- Collateralized &ldquo;My First Business, My First Bank&rdquo; SME Loan that will be  allocated from the Bank&rsquo;s resources is intended to back newly-established SMEs  and tradesmen and, in particular, women entrepreneurs in need of collateral and  start-up capital.</p>
