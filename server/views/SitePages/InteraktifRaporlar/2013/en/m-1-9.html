	<p class="solhilite">Despite positive developments taking place in the US economy, Euro-zone macroeconomic data–especially with respect to growth–remain weak at best.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook for the Global Economy</strong></p>
<p><strong>2013 has been a year which;</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The US economy was  facing a positive outlook, despite mixed economic data releases,</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Economic growth  generally remained weak, despite some relatively positive signs, </strong></li>
	<li><strong>There was a slowdown in  economic growth in emerging markets, while global economic growth remained  below the pre-crisis pace.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in 2008, global  financial markets were largely steered by the policies applied by the central  banks of developed countries during 2013. </p>
<p class="solhilite">
	<strong>7.4%</strong><br />
CPI rise in 2013<br />
<br />
<strong>26.4%</strong><br />
Banking sector growth rate
in 2013<br />
<br />
<strong>15-20%</strong><br />
Projected sectoral credit growth rate in 2014</p>


<p>Positive developments in  employment and housing statistics in the US raised expectations that the Fed  would taper its bond purchases and gradually wind down the process. Macro  indicators in the US were monitored closely during the period and global risk  appetite was closely dependent on the data releases. After the Fed signaled a  change in its policy, there were significant fluctuations in risk appetite,  especially in the second half of the year; and emerging markets experienced  short-term capital outflows amid concerns of a decrease in the cheap and  abundant liquidity.</p>
<p>Countries vulnerable to  current account balances and in need of direct capital or portfolio investments  experienced the effects more profoundly. </p>
<p>The recovery in US  economic growth and in employment statistics led to the beginning of a  normalization process after 5 years. The&nbsp;Fed’s liquidity tapering and  finalization of the bond-buying program, along with achieving macro indicator  targets in the mid-to-long run, will pave the way for interest rates to be  raised from the current historic low levels to more normalized levels. <br />
	Against this backdrop, a  depreciation in emerging market currencies and rise in interest rates was  observed. Moreover, there was a wave of downside revisions to emerging market  economic growth forecasts. Despite signs of a recovery in the US, the weak  performance in the Euro-zone - especially in economic growth dynamics -  continues. A positive growth outlook for Germany, the Euro-zone’s most powerful  economy, became more pronounced - but this was not replicated elsewhere in the  Euro-zone. </p>
<p>Being the Central Bank of  a region which is facing deflationary risks, the ECB continued to apply an  expansionary monetary policy. The&nbsp;Bank cut interest rates twice during the  year in a bid to stimulate the loan market with the aim of increasing economic  activity in the region. The&nbsp;Euro-zone is expected to enter a period of  slow recovery in the coming period. </p>
<p>Japan continued to tackle  its economic stagnation by applying expansionary monetary policies and  stimulatory measures aimed at bringing the curtain down on the deflationary  era. The&nbsp;risks caused by public debt stocks will be the focus point in the  coming period. The&nbsp;monetary and fiscal policies that have applied to bring  the value of the Japanese Yen down to a level where Japan can regain its  competitive potion in the export market, and thus secure economic growth, appear  to have been successful. However, the Japan’s public debt, at 2x its GDP,  remains the main problem facing the country.</p>
<p>Emerging markets, the key  driver of global economic growth, maintained their position by outperforming  developed countries - albeit with decreasing momentum. The&nbsp;Fed’s strategy  to exit QE, as well as the failure of the Euro-zone to achieve a satisfactory  recovery in its macroeconomic outlook - along with the different structural  problems facing these two economic blocks, gave rise to a pessimistic outlook. </p>
<p>In China, one of the main  driving forces of global economic growth in emerging markets, the era of high  rates of economic growth has passed. High property prices and the  liquidity-squeeze in the banking sector are the key concerns facing China.  The&nbsp;performance of the reforms planned for the economy will be monitored  closely. It should be borne in mind that China can wield as much of an impact  on global financial markets as the Fed’s policies.</p>



<p><strong>Outlook for the Turkish Economy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turkey’s economy kicked off 2013 on a stronger footing than in  the previous year; however, like other emerging economies, Turkey did not  escape unscathed from the global economic concerns. </strong></p>
<p>Turkey enjoyed domestic  consumption driven economic growth in 2013 on the back of recovering domestic  demand conditions. The&nbsp;weak performance in global economic activity,  especially in the last quarter, changing risk perceptions driven by Fed’s QE  exit strategy and domestic issues could negatively affect economic growth  dynamics in the next few quarters. </p>
<p>Even though the  under-valued TL could have a supportive impact on exports, the potential for  negative effects should not be overlooked either. With a stabilized currency,  the contribution of exports to growth will improve the prospects of sustainable  growth and the achievement of the targets set out in the Medium Term Program.</p>
<p>The heightened  uncertainties over global monetary policies led to a revaluation of all  financial assets, with the local currency depreciating to record levels. The&nbsp;real-effective  currency index - the main measure of value - confirms that the Turkish Lira has  recently been trading at historically low levels. </p>

</p>

<p>The volatility in food  prices and the sudden fall in the value of the TL gave rise to inflationary  pressures, with inflation ending the year at 7.4% - exceeding the Central  Bank’s 6.8% year-end expectation.</p>
<p>The Central Bank  underlined the importance of the price stability during this period and expects  inflation to ease after a further period of remaining at high levels. However,  attaining the Central Bank’s Medium Term Program target of 5% is now expected  to take more time. </p>


<p>Even though the  sensitivity of the current account balance to capital flows increased during  this period, there have been no financing difficulties.</p>
<p>Excluding the gold trade,  a gradual recovery was seen in the current account deficit. The&nbsp;current  account balance is expected to improve on the back of a slowdown in economic  activity, the measures taken to prevent excess borrowing by households and the  steps taken to encourage saving. </p>
<p>The smooth progress  continues on the back of the stable and disciplined fiscal policies. Despite  the positive contribution of public investments and public spending on economic  growth, there have been no signs of any deterioration in budget discipline,  confirming Turkey’s sound macroeconomic prospects. The&nbsp;2014-2015 period  will be marked by three elections in Turkey, and the stable fiscal management  is expected to be maintained in this period.</p>
<p>The Central Bank’s  policies applied since 2010 have provided extra financial policy products,  supporting financial stability, contributing to the development of the economy  through multiple-product and multi-purpose monetary policies.</p>
<p>The Central Bank appears  to have shifted to a policy composition that is aimed at limiting the  volatility brought about by the new global conjuncture which starting from the  second half of 2013, and preventing any deterioration in inflationary  expectations, in line with its priority of price stability.</p>
<p>With more contractionary  monetary policies, strategies aimed at balanced growth and inflation management  have been applied. Communication is another financial tool which has been  applied by the Central Bank, with the aim of shaping future expectations.  Interest and balance sheet tools are applied to keep the exchange rate at  reasonable levels, with inflation targeted to be brought to reasonable levels  by increasing the emphasis placed on price stability. </p>
<p><strong>2014 to be a year of normalization for emerging markets</strong><br />
Other countries are in a  broadly similar situation, with authorities frequently emphasizing Medium Term  Program targets. </p>
<p>Despite the risk of  deviation from macroeconomic indicators, the implementation of necessary  measures will raise the probability of reaching the main goal.  The&nbsp;progress of the global economy, commodity prices, geopolitical risks  and other similar elements will affect the macro-outlook and policies. Those  countries able to quickly adapt to these changes will be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Developments in the Banking Sector</strong></p>
<p><strong>As one of the most important players in the economy, the Turkish  banking sector emerged from the 2008 global economic crisis successfully in  terms of asset quality, funding structure and profitability. The&nbsp;growth  trend continued in 2013.</strong></p>
<p>The Turkish economy grew  strongly in the first half of 2013, driven by booming domestic consumption, but  growth dynamics suffered downside pressures in the second half of the year amid  increasing risk perceptions. However, the deterioration in the global economy  did not affect the structure of the banking sector, and the sector continued  its financing function without any problems and maintained its sound stance. </p>
<p><strong>In 2013, Turkish banking sector grew by 26.4% primarily as a  result of the increase in loans.</strong><br />
	The sector’s equity  posted 6.5% YoY growth in 2013. The&nbsp;sector maintained its sound equity  structure by limiting dividend payments and measures to encouraging profits to  be left in the banks. While consumer loans were adjusted to healthy levels,  regulations setting out higher savings ratios and structural and macroeconomic  regulations were implemented to maintain stability in the financial sector with  the aim of providing a more stable structure for the banking sector, as well as  targeting improved predictability during 2014.</p>
<p>The sector’s  profitability increased by 5% YoY in 2013 thanks to the decrease in deposit  costs and relatively low cost of non-depository resources. This structure  decreased interest expense and increased net interest income. In&nbsp;the  second half of the year, however, increasing interest rates reduced the  sector’s net interest margin. </p>
<p>Loans have the lion’s share  of the banking sector’s asset structure, while deposits account for the  majority of liabilities. The&nbsp;rate of loan growth exceeded the rate of  deposit growth, leading to an increase in the deposits/loan conversion rate to  above 100%. </p>
<p><strong>In 2014...</strong><br />
Macroeconomic measures  taken to ensure balanced growth are expected to pave the way for a healthy  transformation in the banking sector’s balance sheet structure. The&nbsp;share  of consumer loans in total loans is expected to decrease in the medium to long  run. The&nbsp;weight of loan growth is projected to shift to real sector  credits, which support investments and employment dynamics. Any slowdown in  economic growth amid global concerns, or upside movement in interest rates  could lead to lower loan growth, a contraction in net interest margins and,  therefore, a decrease in profitability. </p>
Loan growth is expected to  be realized at 15-20% in 2014 with deposit growth forecasted at 10-15%.  The&nbsp;banking sector’s profitability is expected to contract slightly.              </div><!-- #midpanel -->
