<p><strong>ZİRAAT HAYAT VE EMEKLİLİK A.Ş. </strong></p>
<p>Ziraat  Emeklilik was authorized for incorporation on 11&nbsp;May 2009 and entered  operation in the life insurance and personal accident insurance branches at the  beginning of 2010. Involved in the Private Pension System since July 2011, the  Company maintained its rapid ascent during 2013.</p>
<p>With a  weighted portfolio of loans-linked life insurance, the Company has been in a  leading position in insurance premium production since its establishment. Based  on the year-end premium production data published by the Association of the  Insurance and Reinsurance Companies of Turkey (TSRŞB), the Company&rsquo;s premium  production increased by 38% and reached TL&nbsp;796 million, corresponding to a  market share of 23% in 2013. In&nbsp;the same period, company paid TL&nbsp;351  million in indemnities. </p>
<p>With the new  law and regulations (where the government compliments all payments with an  additional 25% contribution), which entered effect on 1&nbsp;January 2013, the  Private Pension sector notched up a remarkable pace of growth. By the end of  December 2013, the sector&rsquo;s fund size had expanded by 22% YoY, rising from  TL&nbsp;20.3 billion to TL&nbsp;25 billion. In&nbsp;the same period, the number  of participants grew by 32%, rising from 3,128 to 4,126.</p>
<p>Turkey&rsquo;s  Private Pension System was inaugurated in 2003. Ziraat Pension began offering  personal pension products of its own in July 2011. Despite its rather late  entry into this business line, the Company grew quite rapidly as people were  attracted by the solid reputation of the Ziraat name and brand. By end-2012,  the volume of pension fund assets under Ziraat Pension&rsquo;s management increased  by 133% from its initial TL 169.7 million to TL&nbsp;400 million while the  number of account-holders rose by 193% from 39,819 to 116,666.</p>
<p>When  compared to the sector, the Company ranked 4th in terms of its  technical profitability, with a TL&nbsp;42.4 million technical profit as of the  end of September 2013, according to figures published by the Association of  Insurance Turkey, and was ranked 1st in terms of its net investment  return, which stood at TL&nbsp;75 million.

In&nbsp;terms of its shareholders equity, the Company maintained its  first position, with a Return on Equity of 49%.</p>
<p>Ziraat  Emeklilik sets its main business model as bancassurance, and aims to lowering  costs and increase the ratio of Ziraat Bank customers&rsquo; insurance and private  pension contracts. One of the most effective ways of using the bancassurance  model is to deliver insurance and private pension products through the  branches. The&nbsp;project of offering the BES license to Bank employees has  been applied. Ongoing training efforts in 2013 paved the way for 2,450 bank  employees to gain the Private Pension license. Ziraat Emeklilik achieved a 92%  success ratio in the licensing examination, organized by Pension Monitoring  Center. The&nbsp;success of Ziraat Emeklilik employees in the examinations  effectively raised the average success ratio of the sector from 46% to 56%.</p>
<p>Ziraat  Emeklilik offers services to its customers through private pension plans and  corporate solutions products. Addressing a broad customer segment, the  Company&rsquo;s primary private pension plans include &ldquo;Güldüren Yarınlar Bireysel  Emeklilik Planı&rdquo; (planning for a future that will make you smile), &ldquo;Bereket  Bireysel Emeklilik Planı&rdquo; (Plan for Plenty) designed for interest rate  sensitive customers, &ldquo;Şemsiye Bireysel Emeklilik Planı&rdquo; (Umbrella Plan) and  &ldquo;Pırlanta Bireysel Emeklilik Planı&rdquo; (Diamond Plan) that provides special  advantages to newcomers who enter the system. In&nbsp;addition, there are  private pension designed especially for occupational groups which provide  unique advantages. There are also alternative investment opportunities,  dependent on groups, where employers also contribute for their employees. </p>
<p>On the life  insurance front, besides death and disability by accident guaranties, major  products include &ldquo;Hayata Dair Yıllık Hayat Sigortası&rdquo; (Annual Life Insurance  for Life) that pays an indemnity, not only in the event of death or disability,  but also in the event of contracting one of the 12 dangerous illnesses and  &ldquo;Hayat Arkadaşım Yıllık Hayat Sigortası&rdquo; (Annual Life Insurance for my Spouse)  which offers various optional assurances in addition to death coverage.  The&nbsp;Company also provides special corporate product solutions for the  groups. </p>
<p>As far as life insurance is concerned, the Company aims to develop a  product portfolio in 2014 in order to diversify its products. Efforts are  underway to produce life insurance products which pay death indemnities; this  products are widely used internationally, and have recently seen an increase in  popularity in Turkey too, with the products aiming to protect standards of  living. As such, the Company carries out studies with potential business  partners and reassurance firms. Furthermore, the Company continues its efforts to  implement modern life insurance products and customize them according to the  legislatory framework in different countries, while increasing its market share  abroad. </p>
<p>In 2013 the  Company undertook investments aimed at improving its technological infrastructure.  In&nbsp;the framework of the Bancaasurance project, infrastructure integration  with the main distribution channel, Ziraat Bank, was realized. Starting from  January 2014, the project to provide private pension products to customers  through Bank&rsquo;s computer systems by licensed employees was implemented. This  will enable products to be accessed by more people and raise the participation  ratio of Ziraat Bank customers.
