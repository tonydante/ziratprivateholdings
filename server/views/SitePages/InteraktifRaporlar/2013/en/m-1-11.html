  <span class="footnote">A reception held on 27 November 2013 in Ankara to celebrate the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Ziraat Bank's founding was attended by a distinguished guest list of 3,000 people that included Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ERDOĞAN, Deputy Prime Minister Ali BABACAN, and members of Ziraat Bank's senior management.</span></p>
<p><strong>150<sup>th</sup> year anniversary celebrations</strong> <br />
As part of  the celebrations of the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Bank&rsquo;s founding in  2013, &ldquo;150<sup>th</sup> Year Employee Gatherings&rdquo; that were held in Diyarbakır,  Ankara, İstanbul, İzmir, and Trabzon were enthusiastically attended by 26  thousand bank personnel. These greatly-appreciated events made a very important  contribution to employee satisfaction.</p>
<p>Prime  Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan honored  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> Year Reception with their presence when it was  held on 27&nbsp;November 2013 in Ankara. The&nbsp;event, which was attended by  the Bank&rsquo;s senior management and by 3,000 distinguished guests, attracted great  attention in the national press and media.</p>
<p>The  reception took place at the Congresium International Convention &amp;  Exhibition Center in Ankara, whose exterior and foyer provided the backdrop for  one of the most elaborate visual effects and video mapping shows ever staged in  Turkey. Guests arriving at the reception encountered an image of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  original headquarters projected on the facade and they appeared to be passing  through its doors as they entered the Congresium Foyer. Inside, guests were  treated to a sound &amp; light performance which used a video mapping system  that perfectly matched the scale and resolution of the interior in order to  provide an unforgettable experience as the establishment, development, changes,  progress, and achievements of Ziraat Bank unfolded before their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising Activities</strong> <br />
	As it has  done for the past four football seasons, Ziraat Bank sponsored the royalty of  the Turkish Football Cup in the 2013 / 2014 season. The&nbsp;organization was  renamed as the &ldquo;Ziraat Turkish Cup&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the  2013-2014 season, Ziraat Bank continued its sponsorship of the sport club that  successfully represents the Bank in the Premier Volleyball League since the  2007-2008 season.</p>
<p>In the same  period, in an effort to advertise the Bank, commercial videos of &ldquo;More than a  Bank Abroad&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Football Machine&rdquo;, &ldquo;Saving Bankkart&rdquo; and &ldquo;150<sup>th</sup>  year&rdquo; were broadcasted and gained acclaim.</p>
<p>In the  &ldquo;Crystal Apple Turkish Advertising Industry Awards&rdquo;, a prestigious event  recognizing the best examples of advertising in Turkey, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Football  Machine&rdquo; TV advert racked up a major success by being awarded 5 Crystal and 3  Silver Apples.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Cultural Values </strong> <br />
	For 150  years, Ziraat Bank has supported culture and the arts in a spirit of sharing  with the community. According to its values, the Bank extended support in its  health, education, service and sports activities in 2013 as a part of social  responsibility efforts. </p>
<p><strong>Supporting the arts - an essential tradition for Ziraat  Bank</strong> <br />
Ziraat Bank  has attached the utmost importance to the arts and artists ever since its  incorporation, as underlined by the slogan &ldquo;In Art for Art&rdquo;. The&nbsp;Bank  added new links to the chain of support given to the arts since the 1990s, and  opened the Mithatpaşa, Kuğulu, Tünel and Kızıltan Ulukavak art galleries and  the Ömer Nafi Güvenli Exhibition Hall for art lovers. Seven exhibitions in art  galleries in Ankara Kuğulu and Istanbul Tünel were visited by more than 20,000  art lovers.<br />
<br />
<strong>The founder of Turkey&rsquo;s First Banking Museum</strong><br />
The Ziraat  Bank Museum, housed in the Ceremonial Hall of the Bank&rsquo;s Original Head Office  building in Ankara&rsquo;s Ulus district, was opened on 20&nbsp;November, 1981.  The&nbsp;museum exhibits the Bank&rsquo;s 150-year long history, which has borne  witness to almost every phase of the Republic era, and is the first museum  devoted to banking in Turkey. The&nbsp;Ziraat Bank Museum offers a view of the  commercial, economic, political, cultural, artistic and educational  transformations that the Turkish banking industry has undergone since its  beginning right up to the present day. On display in this historic setting are  numerous antique artefacts that reflect these characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Other Activities</strong> <br />
	Having  sponsored a number of trade shows held in and out of Turkey during 2013, Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s support contributed to the launch of projects that are important for our  country.            </p>
