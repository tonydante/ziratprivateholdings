	<h1>In 2016, Ziraat Bank remained involved in the financing of  large and medium-sized projects that contribute to the country&rsquo;s economy,  reduce external dependency, offer high added value and are feasible.</h1>
	<p>Ziraat Bank, which itself serves its  customers from around 400 points in Turkey, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all  segments of society with its domestic and foreign subsidiaries that make up the  Ziraat Finance Group. In 2016, Ziraat REIT joined the Ziraat Finance Group and  began its operations.</p>
	<p>Within the framework of the seven basic  strategic targets that it set out, Ziraat Bank focused on the growth of the  country&rsquo;s economy and the development of social prosperity, while being a bank  which provides financial solutions to its customers from every segment through  effective distribution channels, experienced personnel and strong technological  infrastructure.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s total assets amounted to  TL&nbsp;357.8 billion at the end of 2016, marking an increase of 18.1% YoY.  Loans comprise the lion&rsquo;s share of total assets with a 65% share. Ziraat Bank,  always aiming for sustainable profitability and efficiency, continues to work  towards enhancing its branches and improving the qualification of its  employees, as well as improving the basic balance sheet sizes per branch and  employee.</p>
	<p>With a business model focused on high  efficiency, Ziraat Bank will continue to meet its customers&rsquo; needs for banking  services and products in all four corners of our country from the right service  points in a timely manner and with favorable conditions.</p>
	<h2><strong>65%</strong>LOANS COMPRISE THE LION&rsquo;S SHARE OF TOTAL  ASSETS WITH A 65% SHARE.</h2>
	<p><strong>Corporate/Entrepreneurial Banking</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Supporting Turkey&rsquo;s long-term  development and development process and contributing to employment and economic  growth in general terms.</strong></p>
	<p>Within the scope of its vision of  remaining the leading bank, the ethical bank and the global bank of the sector  in 2016, Ziraat Bank remained involved in the financing of large and  medium-sized projects that contribute to the country&rsquo;s economy, reduce external  dependency, offer high added value and are feasible. The Osmangazi and Yavuz  Sultan Selim Bridges, projects which Ziraat Bank was involved in the financing  of, were opened to traffic in 2016, while the Bayraktar and Sancaktar frigates  were launched. By the end of the year, the Bank was extending support to 39  projects, with project financing reaching USD&nbsp;12.3 billion.</p>
	<p>In line with its basic goals and  strategies of sustainable growth and profitability, Ziraat Bank, which  diversifies the resources, products and services that it provides to its  customers, maintains its leading role in the country&rsquo;s economy by establishing  new relationships with leading companies in every sector and strengthening  existing ties.</p>
	<p>Besides the financing of agricultural  production, agricultural industry and industrial production, Ziraat Bank has  increased its presence and competitive edge in providing financing the  commercial sector in the recent period.</p>
	<p><strong>Serving corporate clients from 20  corporate branches</strong><br />
		The corporate branches that work with  the aim of managing customer portfolios in the most efficient way and  increasing the number of active customers, continued to contribute to Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and customer base with their business volumes in 2016.</p>
	<p><strong>Progress achieved in the financing of  the real sector.</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank outperformed the sector rate  of growth in the financing of the real sector. Cash loans disbursed to  customers in the corporate segment amounted to TL&nbsp;85.7 billion, an  increase of 25.6% YoY, while non-cash loans stood at TL&nbsp;69.5 billion, an  increase of 31.5% YoY.</p>
	<p>In 2016, the volume of foreign trade  transactions, an important component in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s strategy of becoming a  global player, amounted to USD&nbsp;36.6 billion, an increase of 14% YoY, with  corporate segment customers accounting for 80.7% of this amount. The Bank  intends to maintain its strong role in financing foreign trade in 2017.</p>
	<p>The Bank&rsquo;s main focus is to ensure that  Ziraat&rsquo;s customers work with all members of the Ziraat Finance Group. As the  synergy-based cooperation increases at the group level, the real sector&rsquo;s  financial needs for domestic and foreign business opportunities will be met  more effectively and Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s pioneering and leading position in the  sector will be strengthened.</p>
	<h2><strong>14%</strong>IN 2016, THE VOLUME OF ZIRAAT BANK&rsquo;S  FOREIGN TRADE TRANSACTIONS AMOUNTED TO USD&nbsp;36.6 BILLION WITH AN INCREASE  OF 14% YOY.</h2>
	<p><strong>Work carried out to centralize credit  operations.</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank carries out the necessary  updating and development activities for more effective use of credit products  and systematic infrastructure with the feedback received from the field. Credit  operations were also included within the scope of centralization plans for  operational transactions so that branches can conduct more effective sales and  marketing activities. In particular, work was carried to ensure that the  committed amounts of export-committed credits are calculated systematically and  accurately and closed appropriately.</p>
	<p>As the scope of the CBRT rediscount loan  was expanded, the amount of the commitment was increased from  USD&nbsp;100,000,000 to USD&nbsp;500,000,000 by the Bank and systemic work appropriate  to the conditions of the credit disbursement was carried out.</p>
	<p><strong>Highlights of the 2016 activities in the  corporate/entrepreneurial banking segment...</strong><br />
		With the protocol signed between The  Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey, the Credit Guarantee Fund  and Ziraat Bank to provide business capital financing at affordable terms for  members of the Chamber and Exchange, the &ldquo;Breath Loans (Nefes Kredisi)&rdquo; product  was put into practice. A total of TL&nbsp;2.5 billion in loans is planned to be  disbursed within the scope of the project.</p>
	<p> The New Domestic Machinery Equipment  Credit product was launched in cooperation with KOSGEB with the aim of enabling  those SMEs which purchase new and domestic machinery and which operate in the  manufacturing sector to access financing at affordable terms.</p>
	<p>Protocols were signed with KOSGEB for  zero interest business loans of up to TL&nbsp;50,000 for customers who are  qualified to be an SME and are in the entrepreneurial segment and the Zero  Interest Business Loan was implemented.</p>
	<h1>While Ziraat Bank continues to  support financing for the agricultural sector on one hand, it is constantly  developing projects aimed at solving the structural problems of the sector and  facilitating the sector&rsquo;s access to finance on the other.</h1>
	<p><strong>Financing of the Agricultural Sector</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Sustainable financing models for  agriculture</strong><br />
		While Ziraat Bank continues to support  financing for the agricultural sector on one hand, it is constantly developing  projects aimed at solving the structural problems of the sector and  facilitating the sector&rsquo;s access to finance on the other. The Bank has been  working with the relevant institutions, organizations and agricultural  organizations, in particular the Turkish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and  Livestock. In this context, the Bank is creating faster and low cost solutions  to meet all of the financial needs of farmers, especially farmers who are small  scale business owners, who constitute the most important ring of the  agricultural value chain.</p>
	<p>The diversification of loan products  aimed at this purpose and the work within the scope of the development of  alternative collateral elements from farmers&rsquo; agricultural assets is being  carried out. </p>
	<h2><strong>Pledges  over Movable  Property</strong>WITHIN THE  FRAMEWORK OF THE LAW ON PLEDGES OVER MOVABLE PROPERTY IN COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, SECURING THE ANIMALS WITH A PLEDGE TO BE THE GUARANTEE OF THE  LOAN WITH WHICH FARMERS HAD PURCHASED THE ANIMALS PROVIDED AN IMPORTANT EXPANSION.</h2>
	<p>Within the framework of the Law on  Pledges over Movable Property in Commercial Transactions, for which Ziraat Bank  provided a significant contribution, securing the animals with a pledge to be  the guarantee of the loan with which farmers had purchased the animals provided  an important expansion. On the other hand, the creation of a register by  registering mature trees and the valuation of these valuable assets as  collateral (guarantee) is an important innovation in the application of the  farmers&rsquo; access to finance, especially for farmers who involved in fruit  horticulture and the growing of walnuts and almonds.</p>
	<p>In the coming period, investment and  activities related to strategic products such as licensed warehousing and cold  storage investments, the contracted production model, increasing the level of  agricultural mechanization, oilseed plants, cotton, olives and certified seed  production will stand out among the target production areas for Ziraat Bank.</p>
	<p>In this respect, it is thought that the  most important factor that will guide the future of agriculture in Turkey will  be the basin-based production model. The implementation of this production  model will enable our country&rsquo;s production pattern to become clearer, while the  investment&rsquo;s support and practices that depend on this model will undoubtedly  be extremely important.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank, which is working on its  preparations in this direction, continues to provide the solutions aimed at  meeting all of the financial needs of the agricultural sector with its wide  range of products and services.</p>
	<h1>37% of the agricultural loan  portfolio consists of investment credits (TL&nbsp;15.4 billion) while 63% of  the loans consist of business loans (TL&nbsp;26.6 billion).</h1>
	<p><strong>TL&nbsp;42 billion loan from the Bank&rsquo;s  resources for the financing of the agricultural sector</strong><br />
		By the end of 2016, a total TL&nbsp;42  billion in loans had been disbursed to the agriculture sector from the Bank&rsquo;s  resources (not including TL&nbsp;2.1 billion in the fund originated  agricultural loans balance). A total of 589,282 customers had credit.</p>
	<p>In 2016, 422,054 real and legal persons  were provided with TL&nbsp;27.2 billion of loans which were disbursed from the  Bank&rsquo;s resources and TL&nbsp;7.8 billion of these loans were disbursed without  an interest discount.</p>
	<p>37% of the agricultural loan portfolio  consists of investment credits (TL&nbsp;15.4 billion) while 63% of the loans  consist of business loans (TL&nbsp;26.6 billion).</p>
	<p><strong>Low interest on agricultural loans</strong><br />
		Within the scope of the decree and  communiqué published on interest discounted loans and the subsidy rates  determined on the basis of production areas, customers operating in the sector  continued to obtain loans with annual interest rates ranging from 0% to 8.25%.</p>
	<p>A total of 320,758 producers and  companies operating in the agricultural sector received TL&nbsp;19.4 billion of  loans at discounted interest rates during 2016.</p>
	<p><strong>Contribution of financial model to  agricultural industry-producer cooperation</strong><br />
		Within the framework of contracts  entered into with 37 firms operating in a number of areas including vegetable  farming, seed farming, broiler breeding, pepper and tomato cultivation, sugar  beet production, the Bank&rsquo;s balance of contracted production loans extended to  24,315 producers stood at TL&nbsp;199 million at the end of 2016.</p>
	<p><strong>Mediation in agricultural subsidy  payments</strong><br />
		In 2016, the Bank mediated in a total of  TL&nbsp;10.1 billion of support payments for 2,463,629 producers and unions.  While in years gone by all customers could only obtain their support payments  by joining long queues for the cash counters at the branches, now only 14% of  customers draw their support payments from the branches. The remaining 86%  collect their funds through alternative distribution channels, such as ATM, POS  machines, the mobile branch and the internet branch.</p>
	<p><strong>Cooperation with animal husbandry  organizations</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank continued to offer solutions  that facilitate access to loans for producers who are members of  associations/cooperatives in 2016, by signing a protocol with the Agricultural  Development Cooperatives affiliated to the Cattle Breeders&rsquo; Association of  Turkey and the Turkey Milk Producers Central Union and the Central Union of  Animal Cooperatives.</p>
	<p><strong>Small Equipment Credit</strong><br />
		A new product was offered to enable the  purchase of small farming tools and equipment needed by agricultural  enterprises belonging to real/legal persons, so they could sustain their  operations efficiently and profitably.</p>
	<p><strong>Young Farmer&rsquo;s Loans</strong><br />
		The Young Farmers&rsquo; Project was  implemented by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock with the aim of  supporting sustainable agriculture, promoting entrepreneurship among young  farmers, raising income levels, creating alternative sources of income and  supporting projects for agricultural production which will contribute to the  employment of the young rural population. In accordance with this resolution,  Ziraat Bank implemented the Young Farmer Loans with the aim of establishing  enterprises in accordance with the economic scale and with higher income  generating capacity for the young farmers who develop projects and to help meet  the operating capital needs of these enterprises.</p>

	<h2><strong>50%</strong>THE HOUSING LOAN BALANCE OF ZIRAAT BANK  AMOUNTED TO TL&nbsp;28.8 BILLION, SHOWING AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 50%.<strong> </strong></h2>
	<p>Within this scope;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Within the framework of the protocol  signed with Emlak Konut GYO A.Ş. and TOKİ, approximately TL&nbsp;250 million of  loans were disbursed in August and September 2016.</li>
		<li>Within the scope of the protocol signed  with the Social Security Institution, The Bağ-Kur (Social Security Organization  for Artisans and Self-Employed) Premium Debt Loan product was put into practice  for the insured who have accumulated premium debt and can qualify for the  old-age pension by paying their premium debts.</li>
		<li>In order to optimize the individual loan  application processes and boost sales success, work volumes and customer  activities, the &ldquo;Pre‑approved Consumer Loan&rdquo; product was  rolled out to offer a proactive credit limit to customers.

		<li>With regard to fees and commissions  obtained from banking services, fees were revised including some service items  which had previously been free of charge from some service channels by taking  into account the increasing penetration rates in digital banking practices and  channel-based costs. The Bank achieved the highest increase in non-interest  income in the sector in 2016.</li>
		<li>The housing loan balance amounted to  TL&nbsp;28.8 billion, an increase of approximately 50%, by disbursing  TL&nbsp;14 billion in housing loans (TL&nbsp;3.6 billion in funds originating  from the housing loans balance was not included in the calculation). The  requirement credit balance amounted to TL&nbsp;26.2 billion, marking an  increase of approximately 9%.</li>
		<li>The Bank updated the Non-Banking Value  Segmentation data, which is calculated based on analysis conducted with the aim  of improving portfolio quality and supporting the Bank&rsquo;s revenues, by  determining potential value outside the Bank.

This system ensures that this allocation process is  performed automatically.</li>
		<li>Within the scope of the project to grant  SLA (service-level agreement) to branches when entering requests in  transactions with customers, work was completed on showing branch employees the  estimated duration of customer transactions carried out in the Center at the  moment of the request, through calculations performed on the basis of Branch  Segment, Work Type, Priority Selection, Amount, Transaction Number and Customer  Number. The pilot application was put into practice in some branches.</li>
		<li>To enable the branches to better track  the information and documents related to punitive measures sent through  different means such as e-mail and post to the Center and in the event that  transactions needing precautions or measures are identified by the branches and  to ensure that those transactions are sent to the Center through Fin@rt  workflow, the &ldquo;Punitive Measures Entry&rdquo; transaction type was added to the entry  request screen and this software was extended to all branches.</li>
		<li>In order to rapidly realize demands by  simplifying the collective transfer/EFT definition process, the Operations  Center started to directly carry out customer demands for collective  transfer/EFT definition in the corporate/SME segment.</li>
		<li>In order to reduce bulk intensive  operations in the branches, payment collections for Motor Vehicle Tax are  performed collectively by the Center. In this scope, the &ldquo;Collective MTV  Definition&rdquo; work type under the &ldquo;Corporate Payment/Payment Collection  Procedures&rdquo; transaction type could be selected on the entry request screen by  the branches.</li>

It acts as an intermediary in a  significant proportion of Turkey&rsquo;s international trade with its extensive  correspondent cooperation opportunities and plays an active role in the  financial markets.</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Treasury Management and  International Banking Business Unit conducts its activities with a dynamic and  successful asset-liability management strategy in balance sheet management.

	<p><strong>Balance sheet giving priority to real  sector financing</strong><br />
		Also in 2016, Ziraat Bank carried out  dynamic treasury management in parallel with the economic developments taking  place in our country and in the world. The aim was to reduce the degree of  market and interest risk that the balance sheet was exposed to by achieving  sustainable profitability and customer focused balance sheet management. The  Bank&rsquo;s main asset management strategy was focused on the transformation of the  balance sheet to one that places weight on real sector financing from a  securities portfolio weighted balance sheet structure.</p>

The share of  total TL and foreign currency denominated securities in assets decreased from  21.4% at the end of 2015 to 19.3% by the end of 2016. The Bank&rsquo;s basic asset  management strategy was designed to increase the share of loans in the balance  sheet, mainly those disbursed to the real sector and to decrease the share of  securities. The Bank&rsquo;s securities portfolio is managed by taking into account the  risk-return balance; a more balanced asset structure is created while the  volume of loans is increased in this framework.</p>
	<p>The basic liability management strategy  is configured on the diversification and deepening of non-deposit resources as  well as the expansion of the deposit base. Within the framework of ensuring  diversity in the resource structure and supporting the extension of the average  funding period, the Bank continued to issue TL bills and bonds. In 2016, in  return for TL&nbsp;7.7 billion of redemption, the Bank borrowed TL&nbsp;7.6  billion.</p>
