<div class="baslik">AUDIT COMMITTEE’S ASSESSMENT OF THE OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT, INTERNAL CONTROL, AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS</div>

<div class="sol">
	<p>Internal audit, internal control, and  risk management activities at Ziraat Bank are performed by the Board of  Inspectors, the Internal Control &amp; Compliance Department, and the Risk  Management Department. These units&rsquo; duties and responsibilities, which are  strictly segregated from one another, are coordinated by the Assistant General  Manager for Internal Systems.</p>
	<p>This organization is structured so as to  embrace all Bank units and branches as well as Bank-owned subsidiaries subject  to the Bank&rsquo;s oversight. Its purpose is to minimize any risks that might  adversely affect the thoroughgoing and secure conduct of banking operations,  the fulfillment of long-term profit targets, the reliability of financial and  administrative reporting, and/or the Bank&rsquo;s reputation and financial stability.</p>
	<p><strong>Internal Audit System</strong><br />
		The Board of Inspectors takes a  risk-focused approach in the fulfillment of its responsibilities to ensure that  the activities and operations of the Bank&rsquo;s headquarters units, domestic and  international branches, and subsidiaries comply with the requirements of laws  and regulations and are compatible with the Bank&rsquo;s own strategies, policies,  principles, and objectives. The board conducts its activities in such a way as  both to keep the Bank&rsquo;s senior management informed and to contribute to their  decision-making processes.</p>
	<p>The Board of Inspectors has 151 Bank  inspectors on its staff. The board conducts its activities in line with  internationally-accepted internal auditing standards. Besides checking the  Bank&rsquo;s operations for their compliance with statutorily mandated procedures, in  2016 the board also reviewed and assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of  the transaction procedures involved in both primary and secondary processes. In  addition, processes governed by Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency  (BDDK) regulations pertaining to information systems and banking processes were  also audited in line with the Bank&rsquo;s own practices.</p>
	<p>Board of Inspectors activities in 2016:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Central Audit Team continued its  intensive operations in 2016 by performing scenario analyses which are  influential in preventing irregularities from being committed. The team  reviewed the effectiveness of its existing scenarios and developed new ones to  cope with the possible abuses made possible by newly-introduced business processes.  It has also continued to develop systematic procedures aimed at minimizing  risks arising from the remaining manually-conducted processes involved in  internal audit.</li>
		<li>The R&amp;D Team kept a close watch on  all of the Bank&rsquo;s other business units, revised and kept the auditing module up  to date in light of changes in business processes and the regulatory framework,  and modified auditing points as made necessary by laws, BDDK decisions, and  changes demanded by Bank&rsquo;s senior management and headquarters units.  Improvements also continued to be made in all processes from the development of  an auditing index to the monitoring of audit findings. Systemic changes that  make it possible for inspection findings concerning critically important  transactions to be drawn to the attention of business units increased the  effectiveness of the finding follow-up process and had a beneficial impact on  the overall percentage of findings subjected to corrective action.</li>
		<li>The recommendations that inspectors in  the field included in their reports or made with respect to a particular  transaction or practice were also circulated among the business units concerned  and the outcomes of such recommendations were observed.</li>
		<li>A Global Auditing Module project was  initiated at Ziraat Bank in the last quarter of 2015. Work on this module&rsquo;s  operating system and the task analyses for adapting it to different banking  systems continued in 2016. Negotiations with ZiraatBank BH d.d., where a pilot  implementation of the project will be implemented, were carried out.</li>
		<li>The Inspection Scenario Team that was  set up and charged with formulating scenarios both to identify shortcomings in  bank processes and to develop and improve the effectiveness of such processes  and with submitting these scenarios to the appropriate business unit so as to  ensure that speedy and effective solutions for dealing with them are devised  throughout the Bank continued to operate in 2015. The actions business units took  and the improvements they made with respect to these scenarios were closely  monitored.</li>
		<li>During 2016, the Central Inspection Team  that was set up to increase the frequency and effectiveness of inspections by  constantly and centrally monitoring designated branch groups performed  centralized inspections on 316 of the Bank&rsquo;s branches in accordance with the  same criteria employed for on-site inspections.</li>
		<li>The practice of recruiting qualified  human resources for the Bank&rsquo;s administrative staff by allowing inspectors to  transfer to such positions continued in 2016. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>In keeping with its strong sense of  responsibility and awareness of its duties, the Board of Inspectors will  continue to execute the internal auditing plan in line with goals and policies  set forth by Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s senior management and within the framework of  current auditing approaches, to report its findings to the Board of Directors  through the Audit Committee, and to observe what action is taken on the basis  of its reports.</p>
	<p><strong>Internal Control &amp; Compliance System</strong> <br />
		Internal control activities at Ziraat  Bank are structured so as to embrace the operations of all headquarters units  and of all domestic and international branches as required by BDDK&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Regulation on bank internal system and intrinsic capital adequacy assessment  processes&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>Such activities are conducted so as to  be compatible with the Bank&rsquo;s primary objectives and strategies from the  standpoint of their scope and methodology; however a proactive approach is  adopted in order to more readily accommodate changes in strategies and  conditions arising from altered risk perceptions and from the changeover to a  new service model.</p>
	<p>Work has been finalized on the New  Control Model that was introduced and put into effect: it is no longer just a  reporting model but one that requires action to be taken. The goal of this more  proactive structure is to help ensure that Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s operations exceed  sectoral norms and that they are conducted in a manner that is compatible with  both internal and external regulations as well as with the demands of  competition.</p>
	<p>Domestic branch checks are performed  both on location and centrally within the framework of a program that is  prepared taking into account branches&rsquo; current levels of risk exposure. Control  functions, which for the most part are structured so as to be  technology-intensive and centralized, are intended to ensure that  commonly-occurring mistakes are quickly corrected at the appropriate  business-unit level.</p>
	<p>Taking full advantage of the  improvements in the Bank&rsquo;s technological infrastructure, the Ziraat Bank  Instant Control Project is unique in the Turkish banking industry. This system  is now being used to check operational transactions and their accounting in  real time. Transactions are evaluated in light of specific scenarios and if a  transaction is deemed to be in error, it can be corrected the same day. Based  on the principle of preventing errors and omissions from occurring when assets  and liabilities are recorded and subsequently being used as input for financial  reporting, the Instant Control System has become an integral part of the Bank&rsquo;s  day-to-day activities because of the significant improvement in operational  effectiveness that is achieved by checking transactions immediately rather than  in retrospect. </p>
	<p>Headquarters unit control cycles are  determined taking into account the units&rsquo; functions, potential risks, terms of  reference, and impact on the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet. These cycles are revised as  needs may require.</p>
	<p>Internal control operations at Ziraat  Bank branches located outside Turkey are carried out in line with control  programs that are prepared for each year.</p>
	<p>The findings ascertained as a result of  all of these activities are periodically circulated among appropriate business  units and the members of senior management.</p>
	<p>Besides performing their internal  control functions in 2016, internal control personnel also continued to prepare  and issue reports containing suggestions of ways to improve existing processes  at the Bank and to mitigate the risks inherent in them. The aim of this  practice is to preclude risks by spotting them in advance, to make the Bank  more competitive by improving its business processes, and to increase customer  satisfaction while also taking measures to cut costs.</p>
	<p>As a result of a complete change in the  internal controller recruitment process, Ziraat Bank began recruiting such  personal from among its existing personnel in 2015. This application continued  also in 2016. By taking advantage of the Bank-specific knowledge and experience  that employees already have and thereby accelerating their adaptation to the  department&rsquo;s work processes, this new procedure significantly reduces the time  it takes to train new internal controllers. One natural outcome of this is that  they also become more productive in their new duties sooner. The other is that  the internal control department and its team benefit significantly from their  banking and field experience.</p>
	<p>The practice of recruiting qualified  human resources for the Bank&rsquo;s administrative staff by allowing internal  control personnel to transfer to such positions continued in 2016.</p>
	<p>In addition to such matters, compliance  reviews were also carried out by internal control personnel as required by  article 18 of BDDK Regulation on bank internal system and intrinsic capital  adequacy assessment processes. In the course of these reviews, all operations  conducted or planned by the Bank as well as new transactions and products are  checked to be sure that they comply with laws and regulations, with the Bank&rsquo;s  own policies and rules, and with generally-accepted banking practices. During  such compliance reviews, existing Bank-internal rules and proposed changes in  them are also examined and views concerning them are circulated among  appropriate units.</p>
	<p>Activities to prevent money-laundering  in accordance with the compliance program that was formulated at Ziraat Bank as  per BDDK Regulation concerning programs to comply with obligations to prevent  money-laundering and terrorism financing are conducted as required by national  and international guidelines. Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s anti-money laundering and terrorism  financing policy is publicly disclosed on the Bank&rsquo;s corporate website. All  Ziraat Bank personnel are also provided with training on issues related to the  prevention of money-laundering and terrorism-financing.</p>
	<p><strong>Risk Management System</strong> <br />
		Ziraat Bank risk management activities  are conducted subject to the requirements of BDDK&rsquo;s Regulation on bank internal  system and intrinsic capital adequacy assessment processes and other pertinent  regulations as well as of BDDK Best Practices Guidelines. They are carried out  with the aim of aligning the Bank&rsquo;s risk management functions with best  practices by fostering a risk culture throughout the entire and constantly improving  system and human resources. The principal risk categories are defined as  &ldquo;Credit Risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Market Risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Operational Risk&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Balance Sheet Risks&rdquo;,  the last including the interest rate risks and liquidity risks to which the  Bank is exposed on account of its banking business operations. Care is given to  ensure that all activities related to risk management system are coordinated  through the involved participation of the operational branches with which each  type of risk is associated.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of credit risk  management, Basel III-compatible methods are used to define, measure, monitor,  and report credit risk. The Bank has been calculating its core credit risk  exposure and reporting it monthly on the basis of its solo and consolidated  accounts to BDDK ever since this practice was mandated by law as of  1&nbsp;July&nbsp;2012.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of measuring  creditworthiness using advanced quantification methods, work is currently being  carried out at the Bank based on the results generated by applying scoring  models to different loan portfolios. Statistical methods are employed both to  verify these rating models and to quantify the effectiveness of their  performance. Credit risk limits approved by the Board of Directors are also  monitored while scenario analyses and stress tests are carried out based on  non-performing loan ratios. The Bank also initiated necessary work for  calculating the credit risk through an internal ratings-based approach  involving various departments within the scope of the Project on Credit Risk  Management Through Advanced Methods.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of market risk  management, such risk is measured, analyzed, reported, and monitored. Analyses  are supported by conducting stress tests. Risk measurements are performed on  all accounts whose inclusion in the Bank&rsquo;s capital adequacy ratio calculation  is mandatory as well as by means of the &ldquo;value-at-risk&rdquo; (VaR) methodology. The  results of VaR measurements are validated by means of backtest analyses. The  values on which market risk is calculated are periodically reviewed and  compared with of Board of Directors-approved limits while senior management is  kept informed about the results of mandatory and internal limit monitoring.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of operational risk  management, the operational risks to which the Bank is exposed are defined,  classified, quantified, and analyzed. Operational risk limits approved by the  Board of Directors are also monitored at regular intervals. The operational  risk loss database in the Fin@rt environment allows actual instances of  operational risk to be tracked. Amount subject to Operational Risk is  calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach pursuant to the Regulation on the  Measurement and Assessment of Capital Adequacy of Banks. Information technology  risks and associated actions are followed up. Risk exposure assessments are  conducted for companies providing outsourced support services as required by  current BDDK regulations and business continuity activities are supported by  way of business impact analysis. </p>
	<p>Under the heading of balance sheet risk  management, liquidity and interest rate risks arising from banking business  accounts are measured, analyzed, delimited, reported, and monitored. Analyses  are also supported by means of stress tests. The work on liquidity risk at  Ziraat Bank takes into consideration best practice guides, and Time to Maturity  Analysis is conducted to oversee the maturity composition of the Bank&rsquo;s balance  sheet; Liquidity Gap and Structural Liquidity Gap Analyses to classify assets  and liabilities items according to their respective times to maturity and to  determine the gap amount; and Liquidity Stress Test to assess the Bank&rsquo;s  liquidity needs in the worst case scenario and the loss resulting therefrom. In  addition, the Bank follows up the renewal rates of deposits that make up the  Bank&rsquo;s key funding source on a daily basis, and performs core vs. volatile  deposits analyses using the deposit renewal analysis.</p>
	<p>For monitoring the interest rate risk  stemming from the banking accounts, Ziraat Bank periodically conducts Repricing  Gap (GAP), Duration, Net Interest Income Analyses and Interest Rate Shock  Reduction in Value Analyses. Used for monitoring the interest rate risk arising  from the banking accounts, the Repricing Gap Analysis separates balance sheet  items in terms of their cash flows with respect to their respective time to  repricing, thus allowing to monitor any mismatches among the repricing times of  assets and liabilities with the help of gap amounts aggregated by maturity  groups.</p>
	<p>The liquidity risk limits as may be  approved by the Board of Directors are also monitored at regular intervals. The  results of mandatory and internal limit monitoring and of liquidity and  interest rate gap analyses are circulated among appropriate units for presentation  at Asset &amp; Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings.</p>
	<p>Besides the stress test analyses that  are the subject of periodic reporting within the Bank, year-end Stress Test and  Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) reports are also prepared and  sent to BDDK. In the latter reports, the Bank&rsquo;s capital adequacy is analyzed  over the next three-year period on the basis of a set of Base/Negative/Overly  Negative scenarios not supplied by BDDK.</p>
	<p>The results of the risk management  analyses and the associated risk indicators are reported to the Board of  Directors and to the Audit Committee at six-month intervals and to executive  units and internal system units on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank will continue to make use of  internationally-recognized advanced risk management techniques in order to  carry out its risk management activities for all risk categories and to make  such risk management an integral part of its strategic decision-making  processes in the future as well.</p>
