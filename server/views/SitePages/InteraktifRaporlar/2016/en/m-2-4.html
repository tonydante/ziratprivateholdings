	<p><strong>2016 Activities</strong><br />
In an intensively competitive sector in  which there is a significant international capital presence, Ziraat Bank  advances its stature as the biggest and strongest nationally-owned bank year  after year. Recognizing that it owes its unique and distinguished position in  the sector to superior human resources whose unrivaled market knowledge and  experience enable them to supply customers with the right value, at the right  time, and through the right channel, Ziraat Bank continues to implement the  progressive human resources management system that it has adopted.</p>
	<p>Seeking to deliver innovative and  trustworthy products and services that satisfy the requirements of both the  banking industry and of international competition, Ziraat Bank had a total of  25,015 people on its payroll as of end-2016. As of the same date the average  age and length of service of the Bank&rsquo;s workforce were 34.8 years and 10.5  years respectively while 87% of the Bank&rsquo;s employees held associate,  undergraduate, graduate, and/or doctoral university degrees.</p>
	<p>As in previous years, in 2016 Ziraat  Bank once again continued to seek out and recruit young people wishing to  pursue a career in banking.</p>
	<p>572 Teller/Service Desk Officers and 24  attorneys joined Ziraat Bank Family, who were shortlisted in the recruitment  exams held in 2014 and 2015.</p>
	<p>In keeping with the transparent career  management approach to which it adheres, Ziraat Bank seeks to train its own  managers itself as much as possible. 2,869 existing employees who successfully  took the written and oral promotion exams that were conducted in 2015 were  promoted to a higher job category. The average pass rate on these exams was  49%.</p>
	<p>As a huge family of more than 25,000  members, Ziraat Bank gives great importance to its employees&rsquo; job satisfaction  and it provides its personnel with career-path opportunities that allow them to  advance themselves in different aspects of banking. For example to meet its  requirements for internal controllers, interviews were conducted among banking  staff on 22-26&nbsp;February&nbsp;2016 and twenty people were transferred from  their existing positions to new ones.</p>
	<p>Two Management Training Program exams  were organized in August and December 2016 in order to ready the personnel who  have reached the authorized-level for branch and headquarters management-level  positions and duties. 43 employees who have successfully completed the  technical program, which was the first one of these programs, were included in  the managers pool. The interviews for the field program will be held during  2017. More than 200 employees were appointed to branch or unit management  positions shortly after successfully completing these programs.</p>
	<p>Due to the Bank&rsquo;s need to hire a certain  number of personnel employed in permanent security guard positions and due to  the planned transfer of a significant number of personnel placed in permanent  security guard positions in 2015 to Banking Positions in order to meet the  Bank&rsquo;s personnel need in 2017, 188 personnel working under the title of Private  Security Guards, who had been serving the Bank via a contractor for 5 years and  longer, have been transferred to permanent positions as of  30&nbsp;December&nbsp;2016 in order to meet the Bank&rsquo;s need for permanent  security guards.</p>
	<p> Career Paths, Job Positions and  Assignment Charts, which are attached to Ziraat Bank Human Resources  Guidelines, have been revised. The new versions that will take effect as of  1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2017 have been announced to the entire personnel.</p>
	<p>The Fin@rt Transfer Request program is  conducted twice a year to increase Bank personnel motivation, minimize  operational workloads, and ensure that transfer processes are carried out  quickly, effectively, and methodically. Applications to take part in this  program are accepted in December-January and in June-July. Last year 812  transfer requests were submitted in the first round and 1,274 were submitted in  the second. Of these, 564 and 873 transfers were approved respectively.</p>
	<p>The Department of Disciplinary Committee  was shut down, and its duties were handed over to the Department of Human  Resources, and the revised Disciplinary Guidelines were integrated within the  Human Resources Guidelines. </p>
	<p>Personnel Transfer Protocols were  executed by and between the Bank and Ziraat Participation, and by and between  the Bank and Ziraat Teknoloji A.Ş. This allowed easy reassignment of personnel  to companies within Ziraat Finance Group, while preserving all personnel rights  of relevant employees.</p>
	<p>The Articles of Foundation were revised  as necessary so that the employees of Ziraat Participation within Ziraat  Finance Group will be subject to the Ziraat Bank Pension and Relief Fund in  terms of social security, and the procedures were completed. Relevant personnel  now have Ziraat Bank Pension Fund social security coverage.</p>
	<p>Personnel and employment data of Ziraat  Bank personnel subject to the Pension Fund for Civil Servants in terms of  social security (4/c), and any information in relation to equalization of their  pensions, have been transferred to the Social Security Institution&rsquo;s Service  Tracking Program (HİTAP), and all data for such personnel were integrated into  the program.</p>
	<p>As a result of the negotiations held  between Öz Finans-İş Trade Union, which was established on  23&nbsp;August&nbsp;2013 and authorized to make Collective Agreements with the  Bank on 9&nbsp;September&nbsp;2014, and the Bank, the Collective Agreement was  renewed, which will be effective for a period of two years effective from  1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2017.</p>
	<p>2017 salary adjustments were made in  accordance with the Collective Agreement signed on 30&nbsp;December&nbsp;2016.</p>
	<p>During 2016, systemic practices were  introduced with regard to salaries and payments. Within this frame;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Work was carried out to execute payments  to exiting personnel such as Severance Pay, Vacation Payment, and Reasonable  Benefit Payment through the system and the payroll.</li>
		<li>Work on the payroll accrual program for  the &ldquo;Automatic Enrollment System&rdquo; that will enter force on  1&nbsp;January&nbsp;2017 was completed in the second half of the year.</li>
		<li>A roadmap was devised for the  remuneration of expat personnel appointed on temporary assignment to  international subsidiaries of the Bank and standard salaries were defined. In  addition, standard salaries commensurate with the Bank&rsquo;s practices were set  with respect to the remuneration of local personnel to be employed by  international subsidiaries, taking into consideration country-specific needs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Furthermore, consultancy support was  provided to all domestic/international subsidiaries under the Ziraat Finance  Group for the preparation of their HR regulations, and development of their  career management and remuneration systems. Work started on the installation of  the Humanist system infrastructure at domestic subsidiaries.</p>
	<p>Also, organizational support was  extended for the written recruitment exam and interviews of Ziraat  Participation, which were held in February 2016 and April 2016, respectively.</p>
	<p>Human resources consultancy and support  services were provided during the establishment of Ziraat REIT, a Ziraat Bank  subsidiary that was incorporated on 1&nbsp;November&nbsp;2016.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Bonus  System</strong> <br />
		Created in 2013 to be compatible with  the Bank&rsquo;s new marketing and sales-focused organizational structure and  strategy and informed by the principle that earnings should match success, the  Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Bonus System was designed so as to reward  employees who demonstrate superior performance and productivity by paying them  more. Determined and paid on the basis of periodically conducted individual  performance reviews, individual performance bonuses are intended to strengthen  the Bank&rsquo;s customer-focused business model, to promote a marketing and  effectiveness-focused approach to work, to increase company loyalty by motiving  personnel, and to provide tangible benefits to those whose individual  achievements are compatible with the Bank&rsquo;s corporate objectives.</p>
	<p>A current bonus budget is being  implemented taking the Bank&rsquo;s profitability and operational results into  account with the proviso that the budget&rsquo;s total amount not exceeds 8% of the  Bank&rsquo;s aggregate monthly salary payments. This allocation is paid out to  recipients as an individual performance bonus at three-month intervals along  with their February, May, August, and November salaries based on objectively  defined and numerically expressible specific criteria. In this system, which  has been set up to focus mainly on marketing in line with the Bank&rsquo;s strategies  and targets, bonuses are paid so as to enhance the earnings of those who  contribute more to the realization of those strategies and targets.</p>
	<p>Branch segment and scale group rankings  that have been determined according to individual performance report cards in  line with the numerical performance measurement results at three-month  intervals are notified to employees based on their performance bonus  coefficients.</p>
	<p>The different coefficients that are used  when calculating bonuses are determined jointly by business units according to  branch segment and scale, individual performance ranking, and job position  criteria. Marketing group personnel bonuses are calculated in direct proportion  to the numerical performance points in each section. The bonuses of counter  personnel are calculated based on the performance of the counter to which they  were assigned. </p>
	<p>As is the case with other banks in  Turkey, the Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Bonus System has been designed  to reward superior performance and essentially to increase the productivity of  sales personnel. However individual performance bonuses are also paid to  operational personnel in branches and to headquarters employees in line with  stipulated criteria.</p>
	<p>The Bank plans to start differentiating  not only the individual performance bonus payments that are currently being  made to personnel in headquarters units whose numerical performance is being  measured but also in line with the results of the numerical performance system  that is being set up for headquarters sales units.</p>
	<p>The second competency evaluation was  initiated across the Bank as of year-end 2016. The results from the competency  evaluation are intended to be taken into consideration in the individual  performance system and career management in the future.</p>
	<p><strong>2017 Outlook</strong> <br />
		Ziraat Finance Group will continue to  offer career opportunities fitting the relevant positions and contemporary  working conditions both at the Bank and at the subsidiaries also in 2017.</p>
	<p>Through the recruitment exam planned to  be held in August, personnel will be employed for placement at Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  subsidiaries under the Ziraat Finance Group.</p>
	<p>In order to fulfill staffing needs  quickly, it is planned to place outsourced personnel in the Bank&rsquo;s permanent  staff gradually during 2017.</p>
	<p>In addition, since the permanent  Security Guards, who were started to be employed as the Bank&rsquo;s permanent staff  as of year-end 2015, quickly adapted to the Bank&rsquo;s culture and practices, and  due to the prevailing positive impressions regarding these personnel members,  it is planned to transfer a significant number of them to the Banking Positions  in order to fulfill the Bank&rsquo;s staffing need in 2017, and to transfer  contractor personnel currently serving at the Bank to the Bank&rsquo;s permanent  positions in their respective units/provinces.</p>
	<p>Promotion exams will be held for  existing employees in the second half of the year as prescribed by the Bank&rsquo;s  human resources principles, procedures, and practices.</p>
	<p>The interviews for the Field Management  Trainee Program conducted in December 2016 will be held in 2017.  Authorized-level personnel who are successful in the relevant programs will  continue to be appointed to branch/unit manager positions as needs dictate. </p>
	<p>A project is currently being conducted  to allow requests and opinions concerning changes in employees&rsquo; job assignments  and locations to be submitted online through Fin@rt. For the time being,  personnel transfer requests will continue to be accepted in June-July and in  December-January.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of the transformation  projects being undertaken to increase both synergies among Ziraat Finance Group  members and the operational effectiveness of the Bank&rsquo;s domestic and  international units, the work of matching the staff and job-positions of all of  our international units and of revising remuneration systems and other  entitlements will be completed in 2017.</p>
