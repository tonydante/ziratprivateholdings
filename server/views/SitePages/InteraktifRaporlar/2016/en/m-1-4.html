	<h1>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s 2016 road map, which was shaped by economic,  technological and social developments in line with 7 basic strategic goals, is  implemented by all of its passionate employees.</h1>
	<h2><strong>Stevie  Awards</strong>ZIRAAT BANK RECEIVED  A SILVER AWARD IN THE &ldquo;COMPANY OF THE YEAR&rdquo; CATEGORY IN THE BANKING FIELD AT  THE STEVIE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AWARDS. THE BANK WON THE FIRST PRIZE IN THE  PUBLIC VOTE HELD WITHIN THE SAME CATEGORY.</h2>
	<p>In line with the transformation process  that Ziraat Bank launched in 2012, the Bank focused its business model on  continuous renewal with the principle of providing efficient and quality  services. Within this framework, many infrastructural and cultural  transformation projects have been put into practice. The Bank, which meets the  financial needs of its customers within the scope of the Ziraat Customer  Business Model, continues to spread its high value added service approach in an  expanding geographical region with its extensive service network and  domestic/foreign partnerships.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank which sees change as an  endless journey, continues to move ahead with the methodology that it designed  uniquely. The Bank received a silver award in the &ldquo;Company of the Year&rdquo;  category in the banking field at the Stevie International Business Awards, a  prize platform in which more than 3,800 candidates from every sector from more  than 60 countries participated, in acknowledgment of the methodology that it  had developed for the transformation process. The Bank won the first prize in  the public vote held within the same category.</p>
	<p>Unwavering in developing its abilities  with the principle of continuous development and continuing to acquire new  abilities, Ziraat Bank has focused on creating a common business model by  spreading this development to its affiliated companies and integrating the  Ziraat approach into every region where it is located.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s 2016 road map, which was  shaped by economic, technological and social developments in line with 7 basic  strategic goals, is implemented by all of its passionate employees.</p>
	<p><strong>1.  Sustainable Customer Relationship Management: Ziraat Bank focuses on  establishing relationships with all its customers that create value and are  sustainable.</strong></p>
	<p>In 2016, Ziraat Bank continued to  provide and develop customized products and services by focusing on creating  value for each customer to ensure the establishment of sustainable  relationships with its customers and continued to shape service channels in  line with the needs of its customers. New products, services and processes were  developed in 2016 to meet the needs of customers from each segment with maximum  added value.</p>
	<p>Work on projects for the development of  cash management products to be offered to customers in the corporate segment  continued in 2016 and work related to the Discounted Direct Debt System (DBS),  a derivative product of the DBS, was completed and offered to customers.</p>
	<p>With the agreement signed among Ziraat  Bank and the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) and the  Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) to provide business capital financing and bail-out  support at affordable terms for SME-scale businesses, the &ldquo;Breath Loans (Nefes  Kredisi)&rdquo; product was implemented. In order to help those young farmers who are  entitled to receive a grant from the Young Farmers Program implemented by the  Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock establish more profitable,  efficient and sustainable businesses, the Young Farmer Credit was offered to  customers engaged in agricultural activities. A &ldquo;Machinery Equipment Loan  Support Protocol&rdquo; was signed between KOSGEB (Small and Medium Scale Enterprises  Development Organization) and the Bank in order to provide financial support  for the enterprises&rsquo; purchases of domestically produced and new machinery. With  this protocol, customers could obtain credit at affordable interest rates.</p>
	<p>In addition to the products developed  for the real sector, the State Subsidized Dowry (Çeyiz) and the State  Subsidized Housing Account products are offered to customers to promote saving  among customers in the individual segment.</p>
	<p>The &ldquo;Pre‑approved  Consumer Loan&rdquo; product was implemented following a collective assessment from  the Headquarter for customers who are paid a regular salary who do not have  payment problems at Ziraat Bank and the other banks and who have permission to  be contacted.</p>
	<h2><strong>Digital</strong>ZIRAAT BANK CONTINUES ITS TECHNOLOGICAL  INVESTMENTS IN NON-BRANCH CHANNELS WITH THE AIM OF HELPING CUSTOMERS CONDUCT  THEIR TRANSACTIONS FROM DIGITAL CHANNELS MORE EASILY AND RAPIDLY.</h2>
	<p>Systematic developments have been  implemented to enable the payment of installments for individual and TOKİ  credit from ATMs, following work carried out to increase the variety of  services offered from digital channels and to provide customers with the same  user experience in all channels.</p>
	<p>Technological investments in non-branch  channels are continuing, with the aim of helping customers conduct their  transactions from digital channels more easily and rapidly. The feasibility  studies for the project, which is one of the important investments in this  context, for renewing the ATM software and its equipment are now complete and  the project is planned to be launched in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
	<p>Work got underway on the renewal of  channel front faces to provide customers with a common experience across all  non-branch channels.</p>
	<p>The development work on the corporate  internet branch for corporate customers continued and work got underway on the  corporate mobile branch.</p>
	<p>The Bank is also carrying out  multichannel integration, which aims to ensure that the financial needs of customers  are met with the same level of quality as in all service channels and to create  channels which are integrated with each other for this purpose. Work was  completed on enabling customers to apply to the Bank&rsquo;s products through digital  channels. Customers could apply for the Consumer Loan, Credit Deposit Account,  Vehicle Loan, Housing Loan and Credit Card products, as well as increases in  their credit card limit, through non-branch channels.</p>
	<p>The corporate website homepage has been  restructured to provide quick access to products and services that are  appropriate for the life cycle. To this end, studies continue to be carried out  under the concept of Lifelong Banking, with sub-sites applied in &ldquo;Children  Savings in Ziraat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Young People&rsquo;s Savings in Ziraat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Employee Savings in  Ziraat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pensioner&rsquo;s Savings in Ziraat&rdquo;.</p>

	<p><strong>2.  Institutionalized Business Processes: Ensuring increased efficiency through the  continuous improvement and development of business processes.</strong></p>
	<p>Aware of its corporate citizenship,  Ziraat Bank continues to integrate the principles of sustainability into  business processes, taking part in environmental and people-focused work and  projects. Work focused on contributing to Turkey&rsquo;s sustainable development is  carried out under the leadership of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s CEO and in coordination with  the Bank&rsquo;s Strategic Guidance Committee. The Ziraat Bank 2015 Sustainability  Report, which is prepared in full compliance with the comprehensive level of G4  Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, was published with the devoted efforts of  all units.</p>
	<p>The story book, &ldquo;Başak and Her Magic  Chest&rdquo; was published on Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s website in order to protect the hopes for  our children who will shape the future and to inform them about the  sustainability practices in 2016, which was a difficult year for our country  and the world. The book will continue to be introduced to children in the  coming periods.</p>
	<p>As part of the digitalization efforts  for business processes from end-to-end, Ziraat Bank is continuing its  integration studies with outside institutions. In this context, integration work  completed with TURKSAT enabled customers of the Bank to enter the e-Government  portal with the internet banking password.</p>
	<p> The TURK-VET system integration project  was completed and put into practice in 2016 in order to be used in evaluating  the credit demands of customers in the cattle feed and dairy farming  activities. Integration work carried out with the Notaries Union of Turkey is  continuing.</p>
	<p>The target for 2017 is to complete the  work that had been initiated to achieve process optimization by using barcoded  document generation and reading flow in the Bank processes to create the  central archive infrastructure.</p>
	<p>In the corporate architecture area, work  got underway to ensure the effective integration of business, data and  application architectures with technological infrastructure. Work is underway  to develop management systems that would integrate with Ziraat Teknoloji  processes in order to model business processes and IT processes so that they  could work together on a common platform in a compatible manner and to increase  interaction by providing input to the software from the business processes.</p>
	<h1>Ziraat Bank continues to work  towards the goals of increasing the number of branches in the regions it  operates in and expanding its international service network by establishing new  international branches or subsidiary banks in target markets.</h1>
	<p><strong>3.  Integrated Subsidiary Management: Progressing to the Ziraat Finance Group; the  synergy between the Bank, domestic and international partnerships and  international branches is constantly being improved.</strong></p>
	<h2><strong>Process Management </strong>WORK IS UNDERWAY TO DEVELOP MANAGEMENT  SYSTEMS THAT WOULD INTEGRATE BUSINESS PROCESSES AND IT PROCESSES SO THAT THEY  COULD WORK TOGETHER. </h2>
	<p>The ultimate goal of the large Ziraat  family, which provides banking services on a global scale and has the capacity  for a wide range of financial services with subsidiaries and affiliates around  the world, is not only to offer banking services to customers but to meet all  of the financial needs of customers with the Ziraat Customer Business Model  through all the companies of the Ziraat Finance Group.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank continues to work towards  the goals of increasing the number of branches in the regions it operates in  and expanding its international service network by establishing new  international branches or subsidiary banks in target markets. In this context,  those regions which have deep-rooted historical and cultural ties with Turkey  and where there are Turkish investors, or which offer potential for investment,  stand out as the target markets for the Bank. Within the scope of the work that  has been conducted for expanding the Group abroad, the Marneuli Branch in  Georgia and Bahrain Branch in Bahrain began banking activities in 2016. Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s operations at 99 locations in 19 countries at the end of 2016 and is  positioned as the Turkish Bank with the widest network abroad.</p>

	<p>In line with Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s international  banking strategy and vision, work on the restructuring of the &ldquo;Ziraat Finance  Group&rdquo; continues in order to increase its effectiveness in the countries where  its partnerships and branches operate, to contribute to the development of commercial  and economic relations between these countries and Turkey, to play a strong  role and take a high share in the financing of foreign trade, to respond to the  banking needs of Turkish investors in the country, to provide fast, high  quality and solution focused products and services to customers and to create  synergy between the Bank, domestic subsidiaries and the regions where the Bank  is located.</p>
	<p>As part of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s renewal of  basic banking systems in the foreign branches, new banking software was  introduced to branches operating in Bulgaria in the second quarter of 2016.  Work on the main banking software, which started in 2014 with the partnership  of the Bank in Germany, was completed in the first quarter of 2016 and put into  practice in the German branches. Ziraat Bank will continue its efforts to renew  the main banking systems of its foreign branches and subsidiaries.	</p>
	<p><strong>4.  Operational Excellence: Ziraat Bank is a bank that can quickly adapt to  technology and has digitized and centralized its operations at a high level.</strong></p>
	<h2><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/InteraktifRaporlar/2016/images/en-ziraatfinans.png" alt="" /><br />ZIRAAT BANK CONTINUES TO WORK ON  THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE ZIRAAT FINANCE GROUP IN ORDER TO CREATE SYNERGY  BETWEEN THE BANK, DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES AND THE REGIONS WHERE THE BANK IS  LOCATED.</h2>
	<p>Ziraat Bank continued its process improvement  work and pressed ahead with efforts to centralize the processes so Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s branches would serve as offices where appropriate products and product  packages are presented based on customer needs, reducing the operational  workload on the branches.</p>
	<p>The centralization of processes for TOKİ  transactions was completed in the third quarter of 2016. The project, launched  to ensure the centralization of fund-originated loans where the resource  doesn&rsquo;t belong to the Bank, loan disbursement and collections mediated by the  Bank, is aimed to be completed in 2017.</p>
	<p>Work to centralize credit operations  also continued in 2016. In the process, which started with the centralization  of contract entries, credit guarantee entries began to be submitted from the  center from 2016. Work on the centralization of the loan disbursements is  planned to be completed in 2017.</p>
	<p>The e-archive project, which ensures  that all kinds of documents produced as well as those acquired during the  activities of the Bank and which have archive value are stored securely while  being easily accessible in the electronic environment, was completed.  Electronically archiving the documents provided contributed to the Bank through  financial savings and operational efficiencies, while improving the security of  information and documentation.</p>
	<p>As a result of the efforts to establish  operational efficiency by providing automation in the operations carried out in  branches, regions and General Directorate, manpower savings amounted to 4,346  staff between 2012 and 2016.</p>
	<h1>Selected as the most popular bank  to work in by Economics and Administrative Sciences students in The Ideal  Employer Survey conducted by Universum and HBR (Harvard Business Review)  Turkey, Ziraat Bank remains the center of attraction for young talent with its  renewed business model and the opportunities that it offers.	</h1>
	<p><strong>5.  Objective and Transparent HR Management: Ziraat Bank has become a center of  attraction for new talents while developing talented individuals to sustain the  Ziraat Customer Business Model.</strong></p>
	<p>Work on extending the scope of the  performance management system was completed, by including the sales units of  the General Directorate to strengthen the customer focused business model,  instilling a sales and efficiency oriented work understanding, motivating  employees to increase their corporate loyalty and rewarding individual  achievements which are compatible with the Bank&rsquo;s corporate objectives.</p>
	<p>Competencies have been determined for  branches, regional offices and General Directorate units on a position basis  within the scope of the Competency Evaluation System project, which was  initiated in order to evaluate the competencies of the employees as well as  their target based performances and to integrate them into the performance  points. The system was put into practice in the last quarter of 2016.</p>
	<p>In 2016, work was completed on distance  learning and mobile training to deliver information to users rapidly and at a  low cost and to step up e-training and mobile training programs to provide employees  with access to information at any time and the Ziraat Mobile Training  application was implemented.</p>
	<p>Selected as the most popular bank to  work in by Economics and Administrative Sciences students in The Ideal Employer  Survey conducted by Universum and HBR (Harvard Business Review) Turkey, Ziraat  Bank remains the center of attraction for young talent with its renewed  business model and the opportunities that it offers.</p>
	<p>The Ziraat Banking School, which has  become an institutional brand in banking education, continues to train young  bankers in line with the Bank&rsquo;s vision and strategies. Assistant Specialists  trained in the school before graduating from the school to embark on their  career at the Bank in 2016.</p>
	<p><strong>6.  Effective IT: Ziraat Bank gains the maximum benefit from the opportunities  brought by technology, helping the Bank gain a competitive advantage.</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank continues to deploy  technology to develop its business model so that it will gain a competitive  advantage and to build modern infrastructure systems. Renewal work on the  Bank&rsquo;s data center, initiated during 2014, continued in 2016. The construction  of the data center was completed and the process of moving to the new data  center has begun, with the move expected to be complete by the second quarter  of 2017.</p>
	<p>One of the most important investments in  the field of information technology in 2016 was the steps taken to change the  main banking software. The new software, which is planned to be extended to  international branches in the medium term through the Ziraat Finance  Application, consists of two important components; the Key, a main banking  application and Focus, a work flow application. While work on the  infrastructure continues, the screens and processes to be used by bank  assistants have been significantly revamped with the new software.</p>
	<p>Backed by the new infrastructure, Ziraat  Teknoloji&rsquo;s business model also started to be transformed with agile project  management processes and a model was developed in which business units and  technology teams would work more closely.

	<p><strong>7.  Strong Balance Sheet: As Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet continues to evolve into a  customer-focused structure, expense management is being implemented in a way  that does not prevent revenue growth.</strong></p>
	<h2><strong>Data Center</strong>RENEWAL WORK ON THE ZIRAAT BANK&rsquo;S DATA  CENTER, INITIATED DURING 2014, IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE SECOND  QUARTER OF 2017.</h2>
	<p>Within the scope of the work carried out  to increase the resource diversity, a USD&nbsp;1.1 billion syndication loan was  renewed in 2016, while USD&nbsp;500 million of Eurobonds were issued. In  addition, a loan agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) was signed  for the financing of SMEs and larger firms for the second EUR&nbsp;100 million  tranche of the EUR&nbsp;200 million of financing.</p>
	<p>Work got underway to model the credit  risk with the Basel III Based on Internal Rating (IRB) approach.</p>
	<p>A corporate expense management module,  which would ensure more effective expenditure and inventory management and  bring cost advantages, was also set up. Work on developing the module  continues.</p>
