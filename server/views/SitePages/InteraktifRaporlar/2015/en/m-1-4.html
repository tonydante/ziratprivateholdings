	<h1>Taking both sectoral expectations and technological developments into account, Ziraat Bank identified seven key objectives and incorporated them into its 2015 roadmap.</h1>

<div class="saga">
	<h4>customer experience excellence</h4>
	<h4>multi-channel integration</h4>
</div>

	<p><strong>Aware that corporate  progress is a never-ending journey, Ziraat Bank continues to grow, develop, and  advance together along with its employees and customers.</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank continues to proliferate and advance the  gains that it is achieving through the Change and Transformation Project that  Ziraat Bank launched in 2012 in order to turn itself into a superior-quality  service provider and solution partner capable of satisfying all of its  customers&rsquo; financial needs.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s goal is to craft effective solutions  that will make it possible for its customers to satisfy all of their financial  needs within the Ziraat Finance Group no matter what global or sectoral  conditions may be.</p>
	<p>As it moves forward, the Bank&rsquo;s intention is to ensure  that the Ziraat Finance Group is capable of serving customers in every segment  in three basic business lines: Corporate Banking, Mass Banking, and  International Banking. In order to achieve this strategic goal, the Bank identified  seven key objectives and laid out the 2015 Roadmap taking both sectoral  expectations and technological developments into account. These key objectives  are discussed briefly below.</p>
	<p><strong>1. Sustainable Customer  Relationship Management: Ziraat Bank will focus on cultivating value-creating,  sustainable relationships with all of its customers.</strong></p>
	<p>In 2015 the Bank once again continued to build  value-creating, sustainable relationships with customers in line with its  principle of achieving customer experience excellence in every channel through  which it comes into contact with customers.</p>
	<p>Uninterrupted efforts continued to be made to develop  new products and to improve existing ones so as to better address customers&rsquo;  financial needs. One example is the spot loan product that we introduced for  our corporate customers. Another is the www.evinziraatten.com website that we  launched to help retail customers get detailed information about home-ownership  financing, find answers to any questions they may have about such matters, and  learn what residential development projects Ziraat Bank has entered into  financing agreements with.</p>
	<p> &ldquo;Başakkart&rdquo;, the bank-card product originally  introduced for the agricultural sector, has been expanded so as to additionally  embrace the needs of those in the entrepreneurial and corporate banking  segments in keeping with Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s intention to play a role in every aspect  of commercial life. An important step was taken in the direction of improving  the experience of foreign-national customers at Ziraat Bank branches by adding  English, German, and Russian language options to the branches&rsquo; paging systems.  By incorporating smartphone-connectivity into branches&rsquo; queue paging systems,  our mobile banking customers can now reserve a queuing number for themselves in  the nearest or whatever Ziraat Bank branch they want. Ziraat Bank is the first  bank in Turkey to introduce an appointment system that allows customers to make  an appointment at a branch so that they do not have to wait and can take care  of their banking business as soon as they arrive.</p>
	<p>Efforts continued in 2015 to further enhance the  customer experience in all branch and non-branch channels through &ldquo;channel  optimization&rdquo; projects undertaken to provide customers with effective banking  service through every channel. Continuous improvements were made in the  functionality of our online, ATM, and mobile banking channels to benefit both  our retail and corporate banking customers. Online branch customers are now  able to define flexible as well as fixed transaction limits (transaction  amounts and counts) according to their particular requirements. Thanks to  recently introduced innovations, online banking customers can view the status  of checks and notes that they have received and/or sent to the Bank for  collection on an individual branch basis; and they can also now close accounts  through the Ziraat Bank Call Center. A multichannel integration project has  been initiated in order to standardize service quality so that customers may be  sure of receiving a consistently high level of service quality across all of  our delivery channels.</p>
	<p>Under the &ldquo;Limitless Banking&rdquo; project that was  initiated in 2015, conceptual and physical modifications were undertaken at  more than 200 branches in order to make it easier for physically-challenged  customers to access financial products and services. Ziraat Bank has also  introduced a &ldquo;Limitless Banking Support Package&rdquo; that brings together an  assortment of banking products that address the special needs of such  customers.</p>
	<p>In order to come up with faster and more effective  solutions addressing customers&rsquo; needs, the existing customer communication  infrastructure was strengthened and a new call center was opened in Samsun.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank continued to expand its branch network in  2015 in a drive to broaden its customer reach. In addition to a new branch in  Pristina, Kosovo, 112 domestic branches were added to the Bank&rsquo;s network  bringing the total number of national and international branches to 1,812 as of  year-end. </p>
	<p>Happy to work with all segments of society and  recognizing that its mission involves standing by its customers in bad times as  well as good, Ziraat Bank allowed customers affected by disastrous floods in  the Black Sea counties of Hopa, Borçka, Murgul, and Arhavi to reschedule and  defer repayments on loans that they had taken out from the Bank.<strong> </strong></p>
	<p><strong>2. Institutionalized  Business Processes: Productivity will be increased through business process  institutionalization as well as through continuous improvement and development.</strong></p>
	<p>Increases in productivity achieved through the Bank&rsquo;s  transformation process are amplified through medium- and long-term corporate  sustainability practices so as to further bolster Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s strong national  market position while also enhancing its global competitive strength. Efforts  focused on contributing to Turkey&rsquo;s sustainable development are carried out  under the leadership of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s CEO in coordination with the Bank&rsquo;s  Strategic Guidance Committee.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s first sustainability report, which  includes the Bank&rsquo;s 2013 operations, received an A+ rating from the Global  Reporting Initiative. The&nbsp;second report, comprising the Bank&rsquo;s 2014  operations and which, thanks to the dedicated efforts of all the units  involved, was prepared in full compliance with the requirements of G4  comprehensive reporting, has also been published on Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate  website. Recognizing its fundamental duty to conserve natural resources, Ziraat  Bank helped reduce paper consumption by not publishing a hard-copy version of  its 2014 sustainability report.</p>
	<p>Seeking to achieve end-to-end digitalization of all of  its business processes, Ziraat Bank continues to work with public institutions  such as Turksat, TOKI, Turkvet, and the Public Notaries Association to integrate  their functions into its own.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of enterprise architecture, projects  have been initiated to effectively integrate all of the Bank&rsquo;s business, data,  and application architectures and technological infrastructure. In order both  to model business processes and IT processes so as to operate compatibly with  one another on a common platform and to increase the interaction of business  processes by providing input for software development, work began in the last  quarter of 2015 to develop management systems that will be integrated into the  processes of Ziraat Teknoloji, a member of the Ziraat Finance Group.</p>
	<h1>Ziraat Bank is continuing its intensive efforts to expand  its international service network.</h1>
<div class="saga">
	<h4>new branches in target markets</h4>
	<h4>operations at 97 locations in 18 countries</h4>
</div>

	<p><strong>3. Integrated Subsidiary Management: Ziraat  Bank will seek to increase synergies among its domestic and international  subsidiaries and affiliates and international branches through expansion of the  Ziraat Finance Group.</strong></p>
	<p>The  newest addition to the Ziraat Finance Group is Ziraat Katılım Bankası, which  joined in the second quarter of 2015 in order to more effectively address the  different financial product and service needs of its customers. Work is  currently in progress to set up Ziraat GYO, a bank-owned real estate investment  trust.</p>
	<p>Ziraat  Bank is currently working on other projects whose aim is to expand its  international service network both increasing the number of branches it has in  its existing operational territory and by opening new international branches  and/or financial services subsidiaries in target markets. The&nbsp;most salient  of such targets have been identified by Ziraat Bank as those markets which have  developed significantly in recent years, which have deep-rooted historical  and/or cultural ties with Turkey, and in which Turkish investors are already  active or there exists a potential for them to become so.</p>
	<p>In  line with the Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s efforts to enlarge its international  presence, the Bank&rsquo;s Pristina branch located in the capital of Kosovo commenced  operations in the second quarter of 2015. Having completed their own  incorporation processes, Ziraat subsidiaries in Azerbaijan and Montenegro  officially began doing business in the third quarter of the year. Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  operations at 97 locations in 18 countries meant that it commanded an  international presence more extensive than that of any Turkish bank as of  end-2015.</p>
	<p>In  keeping with its international banking strategy and vision, Ziraat Bank will continue  to: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increase  its effectiveness in every country in which one of its subsidiaries or branches  has an operational presence</li>
		<li>Take  part in efforts to expand commercial and economic relationships between such  countries and Turkey</li>
		<li>Play  an increasingly stronger role in and take an ever-bigger share of their foreign  trade finance</li>
		<li>Respond  to the banking product and service needs of Turkish investors in these  countries</li>
		<li>Provide  customers with fast, superior-quality, solution-focused products and services</li>
		<li>Increase  the effectiveness of the synergies among the Bank, its local subsidiaries and  its offices abroad, within the context of the fundamental Ziraat Finance Group  approach. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under  the heading of renovating the core banking systems of its international  subsidiaries, new banking software became operational in Bosnia-Herzegovina in  February 2015. Work on a similar project that began at the Bank&rsquo;s German  subsidiary is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2016.</p>
<div class="saga">
	<h4>products and services focused on solutions</h4>
	<h4>digitalized operations </h4>
</div>

	<p><strong>4. Operational Excellence: Ziraat Bank will be  a bank which can rapidly adapt to technology and whose operations are highly  digitalized and centralized.</strong></p>
	<p>In  2015 Ziraat Bank once again continued to work on projects to improve and  centralize business processes in order both to reduce branches&rsquo; operational  workloads and so that branches may spend more and better-quality time with  customers and thus more accurately identify customers&rsquo; financial needs and  develop solutions that more effectively address them.</p>
	<p>As  a result of a project undertaken jointly with the General Directorate of Land  Registry and Cadastre, it has been possible for mortgages on real estate  properties to be released electronically by the Bank&rsquo;s headquarters since March  2015. Ziraat Bank is the first and still the only bank in Turkey with this  capability.</p>
	<p>With  the introduction of Aztec (data-matrix) codes on checks, an important step has  been taken towards reducing the risk of fraud.</p>
	<p>Work  is continuing on a joint Ziraat Bank - TOKİ (Mass Housing Administration)  project to systematize data communication between the two. The&nbsp;aim of this  project is to permit TOKİ-related operations to be processed at every Ziraat  Bank branch, thereby reducing the workloads of the limited number of branches  currently authorized to handle them. Work is also continuing on another project  that eventually will centralize all such operations.</p>
	<p>In  the first quarter of 2015 a project was initiated concerning the allocation and  collection of loans out of special-purpose government funds which Ziraat Bank  handles but does not originate. The&nbsp;goal of this project is to  standardize, simplify, and centralize such lending processes so as to reduce  the workloads they impose on branches.</p>
	<p>The  centralization of all lending processes also continued apace in 2015. Ziraat  Bank regards this as the most crucial component of its overall business process  centralization efforts, the aim of which is to reduce branches&rsquo; operational  workloads. The&nbsp;project got under way in 2014 with the headquarters  centralization of all contract-related processes. Current efforts are focusing  on centralizing credit-collateralization processes. The&nbsp;project will be  completed with the centralization of credit-disbursements sometime before the  end of 2016.</p>
	<p>The  final stage has been reached in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s e-archive project, the aim of  which is to ensure that all archivable documentation that is generated or  received is retained in electronic format in a manner that ensures both its  long-term security and its convenient accessibility. This project is slated for  completion during the first quarter of 2016. Besides reducing Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  financial and operational costs, the electronic-format archiving of documents  will also increase the long-term security and usefulness of the information  they contain.</p>
	<p>While  operational efficiency is being improved through the automation of these and  similar processes at branch, regional, and headquarters units, efforts are also  being made to shift existing operational personnel to more customer-focused  tasks and functions. Between 2012-2015, a total of 3,754 labor saving has been  achieved and these employees were reassigned to sales-oriented positions. </p>
<h1>The scope of e-learning and mobile training functions was expanded in order to make information accessible to more personnel faster and at a lower cost.</h1>

<div class="saga">
	<h4>objective and transparent HR </h4>
	<h4>Competency Evaluation System </h4>
</div>

	<p><strong>5. Objective and Transparent HR Management:  Ziraat Bank will ensure the sustainability of its business model both by  improving its existing employees&rsquo; skills and by also being a center of  attraction for new talent.</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat  Bank has set up a performance management system whose aims are to strengthen  its customer-focused business model, to inculcate a sales- and productivity-focused  work ethic, to motivate employees and thereby enhance their loyalty to the  company, and to reward individuals whose success is consistent with the Bank&rsquo;s  objectives. The&nbsp;scope of this system is currently being expanded to  embrace headquarters units as well.</p>
	<p>Efforts  have been initiated to expand the scope of e-learning and mobile training  functions in order to make more information more accessible to more personnel  faster and at a lower cost. It is planned to have this process completed as of  the first quarter of 2016.</p>
	<p> The  Ziraat Bank Banking School, an institutional hallmark in banking industry  education and training, is once again turning out young bankers who espouse the  Bank&rsquo;s vision and strategies after reopening its doors as of the third quarter  of 2015. The&nbsp;school currently has an enrollment of 119 specialist  assistants: 98 from Ziraat Bank and 21 from its Ziraat Katılım Bankası  subsidiary.</p>
	<p>In  2014 a Competency Evaluation System project was begun with the aim of making it  possible both for employees&rsquo; target-based performance to be measured and for  assessments of their skills to be integrated into their performance score.  Under this project so far, the competencies required for branch, regional, and  headquarters units have been identified and training programs have been  designed so as to be compatible with the results of the competency evaluation  process. The&nbsp;Competency Evaluation System will become operational as of  2016.</p>
<div class="saga">
	<h4>IT infrastructure and hardware replacement projects</h4>
</div>

	<p><strong>6. Effective IT: Ziraat Bank will take maximum  advantage of the opportunities afforded by technology in order to secure a  competitive advantage.</strong></p>
	<p>Work  continues on information technology infrastructure and IT hardware replacement  projects that were initiated in order to make effective use of technology both  to ensure that all operations can be conducted without interruption and also to  optimize costs.</p>
	<p>Work  that was begun in 2014 to renovate Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s data center continued in 2015.</p>
	<p>In  the last quarter of 2014 a project was initiated to set up a central software testing  team to ensure that software under development is tested effectively. </p>
	<p> The  central software testing team&rsquo;s testing and certifying software for compliance  with international standards is underway. </p>
	<p>Under  the heading of banking software improvement: a project was initiated in 2014 to  simplify screen layouts and make them more ergonomic. In 2015 this work  continued with the unification of associated screens and the design of more  user-friendly menus.</p>
	<p>Another  important project that was undertaken in 2015 in line with Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  Effective IT objective is the development of core banking software in light of  the Bank&rsquo;s business model and strategies. Once infrastructure design work has  been completed, the first new screens will go into use during the first quarter  of 2016.</p>
<div class="saga">
	<h4>customer-focused balance sheet </h4>
</div>

	<p><strong>7. Strong Balance Sheet: Ziraat Bank will  continue to transform its balance sheet to make its structure more  customer-focused while also managing expenditures without hindering revenue  growth.</strong></p>
	<p>The  principle of equity-compatible balance sheet management continued to be an  important source of guidance for the strategic decisions that were made in  2015.</p>
	<p>In  order to increase the diversity of its funding, Ziraat Bank renewed its  syndicated loan.</p>
A Corporate Expense  Management module has been installed in the Bank&rsquo;s IT system. This module,  which became operational in the first quarter of 2015, is designed to allow  expense and stock management to be performed more effectively and to exploit  cost advantages. Work to further expand the capabilities of this module is  currently in progress</div>
