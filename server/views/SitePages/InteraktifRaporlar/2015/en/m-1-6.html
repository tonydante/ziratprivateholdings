			Chairman of the Board</p>
	</div>
	<p>Esteemed  stakeholders,</p>
	<p>Overshadowed  as it was by the US Federal Reserve Bank&rsquo;s impending interest rate decisions,  fears that China&rsquo;s economy was stumbling, plummeting commodity prices, and  geopolitical risks, 2015 was a year in which investors&rsquo; appetite for risk was  volatile and developed countries&rsquo; monetary policies significantly diverged from  one another. It is expected that this situation will likely prevail in 2016,  though that will depend on the course of both inflation and growth.</p>
	<p>2015 was  shaped by expectations as to what the Fed might or might not do about its  monetary policy. With markets&rsquo; attentions focused on macroeconomic data, they  were wracked by volatilities from time to time. Healthy employment figures and  a strong economic outlook in the US set the stage for the Fed&rsquo;s decision to  begin raising interest rates late in the year. In December the Fed reiterated  its belief that the US economy would remain on track and therefore announced  its first interest rate hike after nearly a decade.</p>
	<p>Now that  uncertainties as to the specifics of the Fed&rsquo;s monetary policy have waned, it  is thought that financial market volatility in 2016 will be rather less than  what prevailed in 2015. Persistently low commodity prices and a strong US  dollar combine with the Fed&rsquo;s assurances that future interest rate hikes would  be gradual are contributing to markets&rsquo; optimism.</p>
	<p>Like the  Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank also had to devote much of its  attention to policies aimed at managing deflationary risks in 2015. Suffering  from the expansionist monetary policies of the latter, the euro continued to  slide all year long. Although it reduced its principal interest rate components  (including those on bank deposits) in order to encourage lending and to manage  deflationary risk, the ECB has yet to achieve what it hoped it would insofar as  inflation is concerned. Although there is some evidence that lending is on the  mend, commodity prices continue to slide and this is what is preventing  inflation from reaching the bank&rsquo;s target. Despite glimmerings in leading  growth indicators due to the ECB&rsquo;s measures, any improvement in economic data  is being constrained by the euro area&rsquo;s chronically high unemployment and by a  huge accumulation of debt. What with oil prices still low and inflation below  expectations as we entered 2016, it is likely that the ECB will remain on its  expansionary course for yet some time to come.</p>
	<p>For the  developing countries, the most important issues on their 2015 agenda were  worries about the Chinese economy, the crash in commodity prices, and the  fallout from US monetary policy. The&nbsp;long-evident downturn in China&rsquo;s  economy manifested itself as emerging-economy stock market losses and falling  exchange rates. Meanwhile the effects of the country&rsquo;s slowdown spread beyond  its own borders and adversely affected global growth as well. With China no  longer demanding so much in the way of raw and other materials, the ensuing  glut of them on world markets further depressed commodity prices. While that  was bad news for countries that export commodities, it helped reduce the costs  of countries that import them. However the protracted nature of this cycle  upset exporting countries&rsquo; debt and growth balances and that is what is making  global markets so uneasy. If the slowdown in China persists for long in 2016,  it is likely that its trading partners will also remain fragile and that can be  expected to further dampen commodity prices.</p>
	<p>The effects  of global market volatilities manifested themselves in Turkey principally as a  higher risk premium and a weaker Turkish lira. Turkish market risk perceptions  were also exacerbated by heightened geopolitical risks in the country&rsquo;s  immediate neighborhood.</p>
	<p>As of this  writing, we can expect that overall growth in 2015 will be modest at best. That  could be construed as not at all shabby in the context of so much global  volatility. Overshadowed by uncertainty and volatility in 2015, the Turkish  economy&rsquo;s growth was nourished largely by domestic demand: indeed, as the end  of the year approached, the net contribution of exports to grow shifted from  positive to negative. Expectations are that growth performance in 2016 will be  better than it was in 2015 and that it will be supported by an anticipated  package of reforms on the one hand and a boost in the minimum wage on the  other.</p>
	<p>Twelve-month  inflation at year-end was around 8.81%. High food prices and a weak Turkish  lira were the main contributors to such a high rate of inflation. According to  the Medium-Term Program, the CPI target for 2016 is 7.50%. As it is appears  that inflation has peaked and is now on its way down, it is thought that this  is still an achievable target.</p>
	<p> Improvements  in Turkey&rsquo;s current account deficit that were registered in 2015 were supported  by a lower energy import bill resulting from the crash in oil prices and by an  increase in exports–primarily automotives and gold. Overall however Turkey&rsquo;s  exports, especially those destined for Iraq and Russia, suffered owing to  geopolitical tensions while developments in the EUR/USD parity were another  reason why export targets could not be met. Fiscal discipline on the  public-sector side combined with prudent borrowing and modest growth in  consumer credit on the private are expected to continue supporting the  country&rsquo;s current account balance.</p>
	<p>The Central  Bank (TCMB) adhered to a tight-money policy all year long in 2015 in order  restrain exchange rate movements and to mitigate the inflationary impact of  higher food prices. Declaring its intention to &ldquo;simplify&rdquo; its own monetary  policy once global monetary policy had returned to a semblance of normalcy, the  bank announced that it was going to narrow its interest rate corridor and make  it more symmetrical around an axis defined by the one-week repo auction  interest rate. TCMB also made it clear that this simplification would be  contingent on the durability of any reduction in volatility observed once the  Fed had raised its own interest rate. All of these pronouncements were made  with the intention of informing market expectations.</p>
	<p>Having  emerged from a period of significantly high volatility Turkish banking sector  remains steadily on course. Its balance sheet growth remains satisfactory.  While the increase in consumer credit is losing momentum, improvements in its  corporate-customer lending are a sign that it is continuing to support  real-sector endeavors.</p>
	<p>As it embarks  upon another year with a robust balance sheet and a productivity-focused new  business model, Ziraat Bank serves customers all over the country. Our Bank  will maintain its leading position in the sector and continue benefiting the  national economy through a service approach that puts the customer at its focal  point.</p>
	<p>Speaking  personally and on behalf of the Ziraat Bank Board of Directors, I take this  opportunity to thank all of our customers, correspondents, business partners,  employees, and other stakeholders who helped us to maintain our growth momentum  in 2015.</p>
	<p>So long as  we can count on your confidence and support, I know that Ziraat Bank will  continue to advance its leading position.<br />
		<br />
		Yours  sincerely,</p>
