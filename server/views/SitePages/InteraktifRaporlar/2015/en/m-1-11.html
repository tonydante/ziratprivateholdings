<div class="sol">
	<h1>Ziraat Bank is constantly on the lookout for alternative ways in which to pursue organic and inorganic growth in every country and sector which it deems to be in line with its strategies and objectives and which it sees being potentially profitable and productive.</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	

<div class="saga">
<h4>competitively strong portfolio of subsidiaries </h4>
<h4>15%</h4>
<p class="h4b">The target of Ziraat Bank’s subsidiaries for contributing in Ziraat Finance Group’s total profits in the medium term</p>
</div>

	<p><strong>A strategy based on  sustainable profitability and growth</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s subsidiary and affiliate strategy is rooted in the  principle of achieving sustainable profitability and growth for the entire  Ziraat Finance Group by: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Maximizing synergies among domestic business concerns  active in a wide range of sectors on the one hand and geographically-dispersed  foreign ones on the other;</li>
		<li>Ensuring that every subsidiary/affiliate is a viable  business concern that is both the most preferred by customers and the most  profitable one in its respective business line.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In keeping with this strategy, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s primary goal therefore is  to develop and maintain a portfolio of subsidiaries and affiliates which  command leading and competitively strong positions in whatever business line  and/or locality they may be active by virtue of their:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>broad product range,</li>
		<li>delivery channel diversity,</li>
		<li>competent human resources,</li>
		<li>lean business processes,</li>
		<li>advanced technological infrastructure. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>An equally important consideration is that they should be able to  respond to Ziraat Finance Group customers&rsquo; financial product and service needs  with the best possible solutions no matter what those needs may be.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank is constantly on the lookout for alternative ways in which  to pursue organic and inorganic growth in every country and sector which it  deems to be in line with its strategies and objectives and which it sees being  potentially profitable and productive.</p>
	<p>A fundamental issue for Ziraat Bank is that its subsidiaries and  affiliates should be contributing about 10% of the Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s total  assets and about 15% of its total profits in the medium term.</p>
	<p><strong>In 2015 Ziraat Bank made  three new additions to its service network.</strong><br />
		Three new members of the Ziraat Finance Group commenced operations in  2015:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ziraat Katılım Bankası A.Ş., a Turkish-based  participation bank founded on 29&nbsp;May&nbsp;2015 with the equivalent of  USD&nbsp;300 million in capital;</li>
		<li>Ziraat Bank Azerbaijan ASC (AZN&nbsp;50 million) and  Ziraat Bank Montenegro AD (EUR&nbsp;10 million), both incorporated on  27&nbsp;July&nbsp;2015.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Other subsidiary and affiliate developments in 2015:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ziraat Bank International AG&rsquo;s 32% stake in  Bosnia-Herzegovina headquartered ZiraatBank BH d.d. was taken over by Ziraat  Bank, thereby turning it into a direct and wholly-owned Ziraat Bank subsidiary.  At the same time, ZiraatBank BH d.d.&rsquo;s paid-in capital was increased to KM  100,000,000 by a cash injection of KM 30,000,000 and a non-cash addition of KM  10,000,000.</li>
		<li>Turkmenistan-based Turkmen Turkish JSC Bank&rsquo;s capital  was increased to TMT&nbsp;61,100,000 as a result of the capitalization of  TMT&nbsp;19,085,300 worth of various balance sheet items.</li>
		<li>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Uzbekistan-based subsidiary Uzbekistan  Turkish Bank JSC was renamed UTBANK JSC and its capital was increased from  UZS&nbsp;30,894,600,000 to UZS&nbsp;36,146,682,000.</li>
		<li>Moscow-based Ziraat Bank JSC&rsquo;s paid-in capital was  increased by a USD&nbsp;15,000,000 cash injection.</li>
	</ul>
