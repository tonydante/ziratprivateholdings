<p class="kirmizi">Stepping into 2013 that marks its 150th  year in service, Ziraat Bank is a dynamic, young and innovative bank.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Our Bank’s target for the year ahead is to  crown its role as the driving force of the national economy with sustainable  growth and profitability performance. Ziraat Bank possesses all the necessary  internal dynamics and energy to attain this target.</p>
<p>Esteemed  shareholders,</p>
<p>During 2012,  signs of improvement in global economy increased; the challenges, however,  lingered on.</p>
<p>While the  recovery process in the aftermath of the global crisis continued, it lost pace.  The rates of growth of developed economies were far from the level that would  contribute the strength and dynamism to rectify unemployment and put the  economies back on growth track. Growth rates declined also in emerging  economies that had displayed solid growth performances in the prior year.</p>
<p>The  post-crisis dynamics were responsible for this picture. Fiscal consolidation  and the weak banking system restrain growth in developed economies. Although  the fiscal consolidation process is on track in many countries, it will take  time for its positive effects to reflect on the economy.</p>
<p>The global  financial system is still not functioning productively. Many countries suffer  from weak banks, as heavy borrowing terms imposed on customers and low growth  rates hamper the banks’ efforts to improve their positions.</p>
<p>The Eurozone  is strongly influenced by the shocks that any member country may go through. On  another hand, relatively weaker banks operating in the Eurozone augment the  shock waves. If these characteristics are accompanied also by fragilities in  public finance, the issue gets even bigger in countries suffering from the  shock and plagues other countries. The Eurozone is in need of a new financial  architecture that will diminish the impacts of the shocks, and therefore, the  magnitude of economic fluctuations.</p>
<p>The weak  growth and uncertainty in developed economies affect emerging markets and  economies through the trade and finance channels. On another wing, capital  flows that vary depending on the risk exposure and quickly respond to policy  revisions emerge as another factor that impacts the performances of emerging  countries.</p>
<p class="solhilite">Drawing on the confidence derived from its robust financial structure and its customers, our Bank is undergoing both financial and operational innovations and change in line with its targets. </p>

<p><span class="kirmizi">In 2012, the Turkish economy focused on  creating the suitable ground for a soft landing with the target of healthy and  sustainable growth.</span><br />
In 2012, the  economic rebalancing process became more evident. Inflation readopted a  downward trend, while improvement was observed throughout the year in the  current account balance. 8.5% in 2011, growth was 2.6% in the first three  quarters of 2012. While the contribution of domestic demand to growth  decreased, the contribution of net foreign demand turned to positive. This  process resulted in a healthier outlook for the growth composition as compared  with 2011.</p>
<p>In  conjunction with the continued issues in the Eurozone, the Eurozone’s demand  for Turkey’s export goods decreased, and the share of exports to European  countries slimmed down. On the other hand, net exports to African and Middle  Eastern countries contributed remarkably to annual growth.</p>
<p>The  inflation declined during 2012. Having registered 10.45% in 2011 due to the  depreciated Turkish lira, tax adjustments and the rise in food prices, the CPI  stood at 6.16% in 2012 owing to the implemented policies, combined with the  elimination of the base effect of the prior period.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>During 2012, signs of improvement in global economy increased; the challenges, however, lingered on.</strong></p>

<p>The measures  adopted in 2012 in relation to the current deficit, a chronic issue of the  Turkish economy, produced positive outcomes, and the current deficit declined  on an annual basis and went down to USD&nbsp;49 billion. In turn, the ratio of  current deficit to the GDP is anticipated to decrease to the order of 6.5% as  at year-end.</p>
<p>The  actualizations of macroeconomic indicators that turned out to be more positive  than forecasts have resulted in the upgrade of Turkey’s long-term credit rating  to investment grade by Fitch Ratings. The improvement secured in the <br />
	credit  rating is expected to steer other rating agencies in the same direction in 2013  and thereafter. It is believed that such a development will bear highly  positively upon Turkey’s investment climate.</p>
<p>2013 is  anticipated to be a more favorable year for the Turkish economy with respect to  developments in growth, inflation and current deficit. Along this line, it is  expected that 2013 will be a year when all economy authorities will be striving  to move to a stable and sustainable growth that is backed by the monetary  policy, focused on domestic demand provided that it is moderate, and watchful  of the inflation trend, as well as of exports.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>In 2012, the economic rebalancing process became more evident. </strong></p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Ziraat Bank, the pioneer of banking in our  country, continued with its development, focused on efficient and productive  balance sheet management, and put into life its forward-looking preparations in  2012.<br />
</span>	Drawing on  the confidence derived from its robust financial structure and its customers,  our Bank is undergoing both financial and operational innovations and change in  line with its targets. While our primary goal is to ensure stability in our  Bank’s operations, our efforts are ongoing to develop a structure that will  allow us to more strongly back Turkey’s macroeconomic targets.</p>
<p>I would like  to take this opportunity to share that we have progressed outstandingly in 2012  within the scope of our change management program that we have based on the  principle &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo;. Aimed at ensuring that the services  required by our customers are fulfilled in the leanest manner, at the right  time and with the right value proposition, the project strengthens the Ziraat  Customer concept and enhances customer loyalty.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>Ziraat Bank will keep standing by its customers and growing together with its stakeholders.</strong></p>
<p>150 new  branches that we plan to open in 2013 when we will be celebrating our 150th  anniversary will serve as a clear indication of the fact that Ziraat Bank will  continue to stand by its customers and to grow together with its stakeholders  as a service provider that rises upon deep-rooted and solid foundations, yet  that is equally young and dynamic.</p>
<p>The biggest  share in Ziraat Bank’s success is attributable to our employees. Our human  resource is our greatest guarantee in achieving new targets. I am fully  confident that we will remain the pioneer of the industry in many more years to  come, thanks to the trust of our customers and the contributions of our  employees. On behalf of myself and the Board of Directors, I would like to  thank our customers for their trust, our employees for their superior  performance, and our correspondents and all our business partners for their  invaluable cooperation.</p>
<p>Yours  sincerely,</p>
