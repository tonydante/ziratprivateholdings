<p>Esteemed Shareholders,</p>
<p class="kirmizi">2012 has been a year when we have taken significant distance in  the project of change and transformation that is in progress at Ziraat Bank  that has been pursuing operations for 149 years as a major asset of our  country.</p>
<p> Being a young bank  celebrating its 150th anniversary, we are targeting to increase our  contribution to our country with our identity as a strong and competitive  service provider that is leading in its sector and operating on global scale.</p>
<p>The global crisis and  volatilities of recent years revealed that the banking industry is a key  component of economies, and that banks with robust shareholders&rsquo; equity help  the respective countries gain some level of immunity against the crisis.</p>
<p>Within the frame of the  basic assets and liabilities management principle, Ziraat Bank has focused on  solid shareholders&rsquo; equity and on sustainable profitability and productivity.  Along this line, while no expansion was registered in the balance sheet in  2012, improvements were attained in profitability and productivity ratios  pursuant to the strategy of maintaining a balance sheet aligned with the  shareholders&rsquo; equity.</p>
<p>Our shareholders&rsquo; equity  grew by 30% during 2012, a result driven also by the net profit. Although the  share of shareholders&rsquo; equity within the balance sheet went up from 8% to top  10%, the process of strengthening the shareholders&rsquo; equity needs to be persisted.<br />
	<br />
	In an effort to diversify  the sources of funding and to increase their effectiveness, weight was given to  loans <br />
	obtained from  international institutions and banks, and to bonds and bills issues within the  country. While ensuring resource diversification, transactions in short-term  money markets were reduced, and focus was concentrated on core deposits,  thereby rendering a more effective funding resource.</p>
<p>Our plans for 2013  include arranging the first syndication loan and realizing the first eurobond issue.</p>
<p>In keeping with the  target of switching from a structure that finances the public to a  &ldquo;customer-oriented&rdquo; structure that extends greater support to the real sector,  our marketable securities portfolio was narrowed down, and lending followed a  flat course. As the share of marketable securities in the balance sheet  declined from 44% to 40%, the share of loans remained in the region of 44%.</p>
<p class="solhilite">Ziraat Bank has focused on solid shareholders&rsquo; equity and on  sustainable profitability and productivity.</p>

<p><span class="kirmizi">We will remain the greatest supporter of the agricultural sector  based on the foresight that agriculture will become a business line that is  equally important as energy in the future.</span><br />
	Our project of change and  transformation is being carried out on two main axes: the infrastructural  transformation has been completed in the structuring of the business model, as  well as financial structuring, and the change and transformation projects in  corporate and global aspects have been initiated. In the process of switching  to a structure that is market- and customer-oriented, we have finalized  customer segmentation for the sake of right value propositions, as well as  branch segmentation for the sake of offering more efficient service to  customers. Thanks to the macro customer segmentation we have undertaken, we  will be managing the agricultural sector more effectively.</p>
<p class="solhilite"> <strong>While no expansion was registered in the balance sheet in 2012,  improvements were attained in profitability and productivity ratios pursuant to  the strategy of maintaining a balance sheet aligned with the equity.</strong></p>
<p>Our branches, regional  directorates and head office units have been reorganized in a dynamic structure  within the frame of the separation of powers principle. The projects directed  towards improving non-branch channels are carried on within the scope of  customer relationship management at Ziraat Bank that possesses a significant  customer base.</p>
<p>An operations center was  set up within the framework of scale economy for the purpose of alleviating the  operational load and increasing productivity at branches so as to enable them  to maintain a customer-focus and offer high quality and high level of service.  It is targeted to increase the efficiency of centralized operations by way of  separating sales and operations. Work is underway to gradually transfer the  banking transactions to the center, and the number of transactions handled by  the center on a daily basis was nearly 40 thousand in the last quarter of 2012.  The centralization ratio of banking transactions had exceeded 50% by the end of  the year.<br />
</p>
<p>Centralized allocation  and loan evaluation modules were introduced within the scope of  institutionalized risk appetite and risk management. We are targeting to  outperform the overall sector in credit expansion in 2013 on the back of our  efforts to capture a robust balance sheet structure, and upon completion of the  infrastructural transformation in lending.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>In the process of switching to a structure that  is market- and customer-oriented, we have finalized customer segmentation for  the sake of right value propositions, as well as branch segmentation for the  sake of offering more efficient service to customers.</strong></p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Ziraat Bank continues to offer service to the entire country at  1,425 domestic branches, and it is the sole provider of banking services at 404  locations.<br />
</span> Under the change and  transformation project, 1,234 branches switched to the &ldquo;Bank Customer Business  Model&rdquo; with the goal of enabling our branches to offer more efficient and  higher quality service; in the first quarter of 2013, the transition of all our  branches to the new model will be completed. In addition, we are planning to  open 150 more branches with a particular emphasis on İstanbul and the big  cities in Anatolia in 2013 when we will be celebrating our 150th  anniversary.</p>
<p>As we have taken on  restructuring in our overseas banks and branches in addition to our branches in  Turkey, we have redesigned our plans to penetrate the Balkans, Far East, Middle  East and North Africa.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">&ldquo;Ziraat Finance Group&rdquo; will be the ultimate output of our change  and transformation project.</span><br />
	We are striving to  realize a large-scale change and transformation project utilizing internal  resources with the aim of offering the fastest and the highest quality service  to Ziraat Customers at all our domestic and overseas branches and subsidiaries,  while increasing our contribution to our country&rsquo;s growth. </p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong><br />
	We are aiming at offering the fastest and the  highest quality service to Ziraat Customers at all our domestic and overseas  branches and subsidiaries, while increasing our contribution to our country&rsquo;s  growth.</strong></p>
<p>I would like to extend my  heartfelt thanks to all of our stakeholders for supporting us with our change  and transformation project that is designed to make Ziraat a global bank  besides Turkey&rsquo;s leading bank, to appeal not only to our customers&rsquo; minds, but  also to their hearts, to be the first name to be recalled, and to be &ldquo;More than  a Bank&rdquo; for our country, and for contributing to our efforts for building a  Ziraat Bank that is taken as reference in the industry with its banking  practices.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
