<div id="midpanel">

<p class="solhilite">The efforts carried out under  the project of change and transformation that Ziraat Bank launched with the slogan <strong>"Together, to a Better Future"</strong>  in a bid to transport its deep-seated corporate values to the future are drawing near completion.</p>
<p>Approximately  100 diverse but synchronous projects, which have been formulated upon <strong>six basic  principles</strong>, are put  into life, utilizing the Bank&rsquo;s own resources.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Principle 1: One-to-one Customer Relationship  Management</p>
<ul>
	<li>Branch  and customer segmentation was carried out aiming to hear out and understand the  customers&rsquo; financial needs and to offer them the right value propositions  accordingly.</li>
	<li>An  agriculture concept integrated with the customer segments was developed. </li>
	<li>Principles  of portfolio management were set out and branches began offering services  within this framework.</li>
	<li>Significant  way has been paved in the shift from a &ldquo;product customer&rdquo; approach to &ldquo;Ziraat  customer&rdquo; approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	The  activities carried out in relation to one-to-one customer relationship  management are summarized below:</p>
<p><strong>Shift from a &ldquo;Product Customer&rdquo; Approach to  &ldquo;Ziraat Customer&rdquo; Approach</strong><br />
	Placing the  customer in its focal point, the Ziraat Customer approach is aimed at  fulfilling all financial needs of customers. Designed accordingly, the &ldquo;Bank  Customer Service Model&rdquo; was started to be rolled out at branches from April  2012.</p>
<p>With the  transition completed at 857 branches until 31&nbsp;December 2012, the new  service model is planned to be disseminated across the entire branch network by  April 2013. The ultimate goal of the Bank is to satisfy all financial needs of  its customers under the Ziraat Finance Group roof. The first steps towards this 
	goal have  been taken by way of the revisions made to the organizational structures and  business models of partnerships and international branches during 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Segmentation</strong><br />
	Customers  are categorized as follows in accordance with their financial needs: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Corporate</li>
	<li>Commercial</li>
	<li>Entrepreneurial </li>
	<li>Retail</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	This lean  segmentation allows referring the customers to the branches and employees that  are aligned with their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Branch Segmentation</strong><br />
	In an effort  to realize customized service delivery, the Bank&rsquo;s branches have been  diversified as follows in line with the type of customer serviced:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Corporate  Branch</li>
	<li>Commercial  Branch</li>
	<li>Entrepreneurial  Branch</li>
	<li>Branch</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	This  initiative helped ensure that every customer receives service from the branch  that is relevant to his/her need.</p>
<p>During 2012,  a total of 109 Corporate/Commercial/Entrepreneurial Branches were opened.</p>
<p><strong>Agriculture Concept Integrated with Customer Segments</strong><br />
	Representing  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s key business line, agricultural banking has been integrated into  all segments instead of being managed on the basis of a product concept. This  approach disseminated the service delivery over a broad range from farmers to  agribusiness. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Portfolio Management</strong><br />
	Customers to  be serviced by each employee in branches have been identified; thanks to this  practice, employees closely monitor the financial status and needs of the  customers assigned to them, and offer them service at the right time through  the right channel.</p>
<p>Formerly a  bank with an operational focus, Ziraat Bank reached a &ldquo;customer relationship&rdquo;  team of 7,880 people at 1,490 points of service on the back of the initiatives  finalized during 2012, and was transformed into the most extensive bank with  customer-focus in Turkey.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Principle 2: Institutionalized Risk Appetite</span><br />
Credit risk  management at Ziraat Bank is the pivotal building stone with respect to  effective transfer of lending policies to the field and establishment of a  shared credit culture at all branches.</p>
<p>Within the  frame of the efforts to create enterprise risk appetite, the Bank launched  major decision support systems including &ldquo;Retail Loans Assessment Module&rdquo;, &ldquo;SME  Assessment Module&rdquo; and &ldquo;Company Assessment Module&rdquo;. This enabled uniform  conditions of lending to retail customers or commercial business customers  irrespective of the Bank branch they apply.</p>
<p>Along this  line, centralized allocation of retail loans began as of May 2012, and vast majority  of branches were incorporated under the central allocation structure by the end  of 2012. During the reporting period, 84% of retail loan applications have been  assessed using this system.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Principle 3: Efficient Information Technology  and Productive Operational Infrastructure</span><br />
	In 2012,  Ziraat Bank took important steps towards becoming the leader in the area of  technology, as well.</p>
<p>A  substantial part of the Information Technology (IT) projects was brought to  completion during 2012, which aimed to offer efficient service to customers  also through non-branch channels, provide uninterrupted service, and correctly  identify customers&rsquo; needs. On another front, efforts are underway in relation  to process management system based on operational productivity, which were  initiated in 2012. Steps have been taken to make sure that all actions for the  fulfillment of the Bank&rsquo;s technology needs are taken in a way that is  centralized, planned, visionary, and integrated with its partnerships.</p>
<p>An  Operations Center was set up for the purposes of ensuring productivity in  operational transactions, alleviating the operational workload on branches, and  thus allowing the branches to allocate more quality time to customers.  Operational transactions were started to be moved to this center gradually.</p>
<p>In the last  quarter of 2012, the number of transactions handled by the center averaged  41,368 on a daily basis. The centralization ratio of operational transactions  rose to 51% by year-end 2012.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Principle 4: Objective and Transparent Human  Resource Management</span><br />
Pursuant to  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s HR policy that places the human at the core, it is of the utmost  importance that employees work at positions that suit their competencies and  enjoy job satisfaction. To this end, the Bank moved from the title-based  vertical organizational structure to the job position-based horizontal  organizational structure during 2012.</p>
<p>Efforts are  in progress, which are intended to support the Bank&rsquo;s employees with any tool  that reveals their potentials and to assess their performances objectively. The  work in relation to the Individual Performance Appraisal System has been  brought to completion as at year-end 2012. Competencies have been identified on  the basis of job positions and relevant behavioral patterns have been  formulated, while work was initiated for career and talent management systems.</p>
<p>In line with  the Bank&rsquo;s transparency principle, employees are informed of any development  concerning the human resources.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Principle 5: Robust Shareholders&rsquo; Equity</span><br />
	Sustainable  profitability and growth make up a key objective of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s project  &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo;. Despite the rising performance of the Bank&rsquo;s  assets that have displayed remarkable expansion in the recent years, the ratio  of shareholders&rsquo; equity to the balance sheet diminished. For this reason, the  Bank began working to attain a balance sheet structure that is aligned  primarily with the shareholders&rsquo; equity.</p>
<p>Significant  distance has been taken in efforts launched at Ziraat Bank for the following  purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Diversification  of the Bank&rsquo;s non-deposit resources within the frame of effective balance sheet  management,</li>
	<li>Reducing  the share of marketable securities within the balance sheet, which is an aspect  of the Bank that is differentiated from the overall sector, to the sector&rsquo;s  average figures,</li>
	<li>Bringing  non-interest income closer to the sector&rsquo;s average figures on the back of  enhanced service quality.</li>
	</ul>
<p><br />
	<span class="kirmizi">Principle 6: Effective Communication</span><br />
Within the  scope of the &ldquo;First Step Meetings&rdquo; that lasted approximately five months,  Hüseyin Aydın, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s General Manager, got together with 22,500  employees in 21 cities and explained the reason why the Bank needs  transformation, sharing the details of the project &ldquo;Together, to a Better  Future&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Internal  communication channels have been created to communicate the innovations and  changes carried out under the project &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo;, and the  employees were given access to information on the project through the Together,  to a Better Future Sharing Platform and the weekly bulletin.</p>
<p>Together, to  a Better Future Sharing Platform is a platform accessible from the portal and  serves to internal information sharing. Using this tool, employees take part in  questionnaires regarding the project, convey their ideas on innovations and  changes, and access important information and instant news about the project.  Every Tuesday, the changes and innovations realized during the preceding week  are emailed to employees in the form of the Together, to a Better Future  Bulletin.</p>
<p>In order to  facilitate communication between the Head Office and branches and to convey  project requirements to all employees, a team of approximately 300 people was  set up under the name Transformation Volunteers, which is participated by  employees working in different cities of Turkey. The team is responsible for  quick completion of preparations at branches that will shift to the new service  model, and for swift resolution of the issues of branches by the right units.  Thanks to the team, the project was efficiently finalized.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>Forging  ahead with its change and transformation initiatives, Ziraat Bank advances  &ldquo;Together, toward the Target&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">The common goal of all these initiatives is to  be &ldquo;More than a Bank&rdquo;.</span><br />
	Ziraat Bank  is different from other banks; it is a special bank for Turkey.</p>
<p>Always  bearing in mind that it is &ldquo;more than a bank&rdquo; for its customers, the Bank aims  at becoming </p>
<ul>
	<li>a  morale bank,</li>
	<li>a  global bank,</li>
	<li>a  leading bank</li>
</ul>
<p>while  remaining strictly adhered to its corporate values that set it apart from its  peers.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Ziraat Bank targets to be a;</span><br />
	<strong>Morale Bank</strong><br />
	A bank that  offers banking services to everyone in the future just as it has done in the  past, that all segments of the society is pleased to be working with, and that  stands by its customers in bad times, as much as in good times,</p>
<p><strong>Global Bank</strong><br />
	As an  institution possessing the necessary infrastructure to deliver global service  via its domestic and overseas partnerships and branches, capture a uniform  service quality and level in all countries where it has a presence and become a  competitive bank enjoying high market capitalization and engaged in world-class  banking business,</p>
<p><strong>Leading Bank</strong><br />
	Not be  content with being Turkey&rsquo;s biggest and strongest bank, but support its scale  with its profitability and promote Ziraat Finance Group to a leading position  across the globe.</p>
<p> <span class="kirmizi">In the 150<sup>th</sup> year, &ldquo;Together, toward  the Target&rdquo;</span><br />
	To achieve  these objectives, Ziraat Bank will proceed &ldquo;Together, toward the Target&rdquo; in  2013 and carry on with activities geared at change and transformation, and will  continue to work at full speed to be &ldquo;more than a bank&rdquo; in its 150<sup>th</sup>  anniversary. </p>
