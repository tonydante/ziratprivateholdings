<p class="solhilite"><strong>During 2012, Ziraat Bank uninterruptedly carried on with its efforts towards the "Bank and Ziraat Customer" structuring.</strong></p>
<p>During 2012,  Ziraat Bank uninterruptedly carried on with its efforts towards the &ldquo;Bank and  Ziraat Customer&rdquo; structuring formulated with a view to fulfilling the financial  needs of its customers through the right channel, at the right time, and with  the right value propositions.</p>
<p>Through this  change and transformation project, the Bank intends to achieve increased  efficiency and productivity in its customer relationships, and lending  processes and policies.</p>
<p>Having  successfully completed yet another operating period, Ziraat Bank set its  financial management strategy as: </p>
<ul>
	<li>possessing  a shareholders&rsquo; equity that is aligned with the size of the balance sheet, </li>
	<li>increasing  the relative share of loans, </li>
	<li>attaining  an effective and diversified funding resource. </li>
</ul>
<p class="solhilite"><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/InteraktifRaporlar/2012/images/en5.png" alt="" width="170" height="506" /><br /><br />
	<strong>In 2012, Ziraat Bank captured marked upward trends in profitability and productivity ratios.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
	Balance sheet size aligned with shareholders’  equity</strong><br />
Molding its  activities so as to attain a well-balanced balance sheet structure, Ziraat  Bank’s total assets were worth TL&nbsp;162,868 million as at year-end 2012.  Aiming to render profitability sustainable, which is an important component of  shareholders’ equity, the Bank posted year-end net profits in the amount of  TL&nbsp;2,650 million, up 26% year-to-year.</p>
<p>In parallel  with the increased profit, the Bank captured marked upward trends in  profitability and productivity ratios, which also take place among the Bank’s  important agenda items. 16.1% in 2011, return on equity (RoE) went up to 17.6%  in 2012. Similarly, return on assets (RoA) also increased and rose from 1.3% in  2011 to 1.7% in 2012.</p>
<p>Worth  TL&nbsp;71 billion at year-end 2012, Ziraat Bank’s total lending took 44% share  of the Bank’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>As at 2012,  the Bank’s total deposits amounted to TL&nbsp;119 billion, and the share of  deposits to total liabilities was 73%. Savings deposits made up the greatest  portion of deposits with 48%.</p>
<p><strong>Continuously expanding domestic service network</strong><br />
Turkey’s  most extensive bank, Ziraat Bank carried on with its efforts to expand its  service network at full speed also in 2012. The total number of the Bank’s  domestic branches reached 1,425 including the newly created 5 corporate, 27  commercial and 77 entrepreneurial branches, and continued to serve solo to  fulfill the people’s banking needs at 404 locations in Turkey.</p>
<p>As at  year-end, Ziraat Bank’s service network consisted of 1,490 domestic points of  service made up of;</p>
<ul>
	<li>1,425  domestic branches,</li>
	<li>31  special transaction centers,</li>
	<li>32  bureaus,</li>
	<li>2  mobile vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	Within the  scope of domestic branch network expansion efforts, Ziraat Bank will keep  opening new branches in the future, with a particular focus on İstanbul and  districts where no other bank is present, and continue to contribute to the  country’s employment.</p>
<p><strong>New business model structuring under the change  and transformation project</strong><br />
	Under the  change and transformation project in progress, Ziraat Bank is formulating a new  business model that will be able to respond more effectively to its customers’  needs. The new business model redefined the Bank’s code of conduct, carried out  customer segmentation, redesigned regions and branches in alignment with this  segmentation, and created a matrix organizational structure with domestic and  overseas subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Within the  scope of the Bank’s new organizational structure, the customers were  categorized as follows according to their financial needs: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Corporate</li>
	<li>Commercial</li>
	<li>Entrepreneurial </li>
	<li>Retail</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	Along this  line, branches were diversified as Entrepreneurial Branches, Corporate  Branches, Commercial Branches and Branches depending on the type of customers  they serviced, so as to ensure customized service delivery.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>More than 40,000 new customers have been acquired for the Bank under the entrepreneurial segment.</strong></p>
<p class="kirmizi">Entrepreneurial Banking</p>
<p>In 2012  during which Ziraat Bank was in the process of change and transformation, the  Bank worked heavily to switch to the Bank Customer Service Model, which was  molded on the &ldquo;Customer-Oriented Banking&rdquo; concept.</p>
<p>In this  context, customer and branch segmentation were brought to completion and  portfolio management was launched to ensure that the right services are  delivered to the customers effectively through the right channels.</p>
<p>Customers  are offered service efficiently by 241 Customer Relationship Managers (CRMs)  and 212 Customer Relationship Assistants (CRAs) at the 77 Entrepreneurial  branches opened during 2012, and by 1,138 CRMs and 800 CRAs at 748 branches  operating under the Bank Customer Service Model, for a total of 1,379  Entrepreneurial CRMs and 1,012 Entrepreneurial CRAs.</p>
<p>Below is a  summary of the activities carried out within the scope of entrepreneurial  banking in 2012, when a switch was made to the Bank Customer Service Model:</p>
<ul>
	<li>More  than 40,000 new customers have been acquired for the Bank under the  entrepreneurial segment. In addition, approximately 54,000 inactive customers  on the Bank&rsquo;s portfolio have been rendered active, who are now effectively  working in cooperation with the Bank.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>The  Bank&rsquo;s existing portfolio composition was significantly revamped, and weight  was given to foreign trade and service sectors with special emphasis on  manufacturing, employment, trade and export at micro, small and medium-sized  establishments, with the target of replacing quantity with quality.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>The  Bank continued to extend loans at advantageous terms to the members of chambers  of industry, commerce and tradesmen across Turkey, which have a credit protocol  with Ziraat Bank.<br />
		<br />
	</li>
	<li>The  collaboration that the Bank initiated with development agencies to contribute  to regional economic development and social progress continued and further  increased.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank developed synergetic cooperation  with numerous national and international agencies to provide long-term  financing to the SMEs that account for a substantial portion of commercial and  economic activity in our country, to contribute to their operating capitals,  and to support their growth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>World Bank loans for small and medium-sized  enterprises</strong><br />
	The World  Bank’s loans are set apart from the other loans available in the sector in that  they provide long-term, low-cost investment and operating finance with grace  periods and flexible repayment terms. Ziraat Bank continued to channel the  loans secured from the World Bank to the SMEs in 2012, which had been started  to be allocated in 2010.</p>
<p>Within the  scope of the Access to Finance for SMEs Project, businesses’ access to  financing were given increased depth and breadth with the modified legislation  during 2012, in line with the understanding to offer the funds secured from the  World Bank for fulfilling the financing needs of small and medium-sized  enterprises with the right value proposition.</p>
<p>The contacts  for obtaining medium- and long-term funds from the World Bank continued  throughout 2012, and a new collaboration is planned to be put into life within  the framework of a new project in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>EIB loan for the operating capital needs of  SMEs</strong><br />
In 2012,  Ziraat Bank arranged a loan in the amount of EUR&nbsp;100 million from the  European Investment Bank (EIB) for which the guarantor was the Turkish  Treasury. The loans extended in this frame are intended to fund the investments  the SMEs will make in Turkey and their operating capital needs in an effort to  support the growth of SMEs through increasing their production, productivity  and employment.</p>
<p>Planning to  renew the project in 2013 that achieved a high success level of realization,  Ziraat Bank will continue to provide financing support to its SME customers  through the additional resource to be obtained.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;My First Business, My First Bank&rdquo; loan  collateralized by the European Investment Fund </strong><br />
	A guarantee  agreement incorporating collateral for the cash loan volume of TL&nbsp;300  million has been signed by and between the European Investment Fund (EIF) and  the Bank for financing the operations of the SMEs at inexpensive costs without  imposing the burden of additional collateral for their access to funds.</p>
<p>Under the  agreement, the EIB-Collateralized &ldquo;My First Business, My First Bank&rdquo; SME Loan  that will be allocated from the Bank&rsquo;s resources is intended to back  newly-established SMEs and tradesmen and particularly women entrepreneurs that  are in need of collateral and start-up capital. In addition, Ziraat Bank  practices positive discrimination for women entrepreneurs by offering them  additional interest rate discounts, longer terms, and grace period options.</p>
<p>Within the  scope of the collateral support program secured from the EIF by year-end 2011,  the Bank started allocating loans in the amount of TL&nbsp;50,000 in 2012 to  small entrepreneurs who will start up a new business or who own businesses  younger than 5 years against their personal guarantee. Significantly helping  the businesses that recently start operations with their access to external  funds, the project is intended to lend support to Turkey&rsquo;s young and dynamic  entrepreneur force.</p>
<p><strong>Incentive for the development of export companies</strong><br />
In 2012,  Ziraat Bank cooperated also with resident financial institutions to support the  SMEs. The representative of the Turkish private sector, Foreign Economic  Relations Board (in Turkish: DEİK) launched a project that will increase the exports  of the Turkish machinery industry with the support to sharpen competitiveness  and formulate export strategies, which will enable the achievement of the  Ministry of Economy’s target to reach USD&nbsp;500 billion in exports by 2023.  For the project, the Bank executed a protocol with the DEİK.</p>
<p>Under the  protocol, companies applying to the Bank are offered 75% subsidy for utilizing  the services of needs analyses, training and consultancy, overseas marketing  (joint market research, market visits, trade delegations, visits to overseas  trade shows, matching and group introduction activities), purchasing  delegations and personal consultancy via the contractor firm.</p>
<p>Acting as  the solution partner of export companies through its overseas service network,  Ziraat Bank provided an incentive of up to USD&nbsp;200,000 for the preparation  of strategy reports, again in cooperation with the DEİK. These reports will  help businesses penetrate international markets and serve to their integration  with the global economy.</p>
<p><strong>Support to the domestic machinery manufacturing  industry</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank  is the greatest supporter of the companies engaged in the manufacturing and  exportation of domestic machinery, as well as companies that need financing for  the purchase of domestic machinery.</p>
<p>Intended for  fulfilling these companies’ investment needs for purchasing new domestic machinery  from Turkey, their operating capital requirements that result from the  investment, and their foreign trade financing needs, preparations for the loan  package were completed during 2012 and it will be put in use for  entrepreneurial customers during 2013.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>Within its primary targets, Ziraat Bank attaches top priority to the development and growth of the agricultural sector and its acquiring global competitive strength.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Efficient cooperation with KOSGEB and Türk  Eximbank</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank  efficiently cooperates with KOSGEB (Small and Medium Enterprises Development  Organization) and Türk Eximbank to allow customers to quickly benefit from  non-Bank-funded export loans besides offering attractive Bank-funded FX loan  facilities to the exporters.</p>
<p>Offering  inexpensive TL/FC operating loans to exporter companies, the Bank also makes  available the forwards instrument with special advantages, which protects the  businesses against volatilities in exchange rates. An important business  partner of Türk Eximbank, the Bank intermediates the allocation of pre-shipment  export loans and SME pre-export facilities. The Bank also carries out letter of  credit and acceptance/endorsement transactions and prefinancing transactions  for import trade financing. </p>
<p>Standing by  and supporting the SMEs also through the rough times, Ziraat Bank postponed the  debts of SMEs that have sustained losses in the Van Earthquake of 2011. In  addition, the Bank joined the KOSGEB’s interest support program launched for  the SMEs by reason of the earthquake, and thus, continued to extend support to  the SMEs.</p>
<p><strong>Sector-specific support packages</strong><br />
The  Pharmacist Package was introduced in 2012, which was aimed at satisfying the  operating capital, medical equipment financing, and place of business and  vehicle purchases of the Bank&rsquo;s customers active in the pharmaceuticals  industry.</p>
<p>In addition,  the Tourism Support Package was offered for the short-, medium- and long-term  operating finance needs of the tourism sector and its interacting sectors, as  well as for their borrowing needs that can be considered within the context of  &ldquo;new investment&rdquo; and &ldquo;renovation loans&rdquo;. The package incorporates flexible 
	repayment  alternatives that suit the relevant sector, grace period options, and  advantageous interest choices.</p>
<p><strong>By the side of the customer in agricultural  banking </strong><br />
	Within its  primary targets, Ziraat Bank attaches top priority to the development and  growth of the agricultural sector and its acquiring global competitive  strength.</p>
<p>Taking place  in every phase of financing the agricultural production, agricultural industry  and industrial production on the back of the transformation it launched in  2012, the Bank took into consideration the resulting added value, and set it as  its main target to work with all actors along the value chain.</p>

<p><strong>Customer-oriented approach to banking</strong><br />
	The change  and transformation activities conducted by Ziraat Bank in 2012, and the  relevant training offered to employees were intended to integrate  customer-oriented sales, high productivity, healthy growth and sustainable  profitability into the Bank’s code of conduct, as well as to create a new  understanding of working across the Bank.</p>

The Bank espouses a pricing strategy  that is not aggressive, places emphasis on broad-based deposits, and develops  policies seeking to promote saving tendency and to attract small savings to the  Bank.</p>
<p>Carrying on  with its customer-oriented, effective and productive cash management practices  at full speed during 2012, Ziraat Bank increased the number of  institutions/companies under protocol for collection/payment/general  banking/direct debit system to 527.</p>
<p>During the  reporting period, the collections performed for 71.3 million transactions using  the Corporate Collection Systems were worth TL&nbsp;81.5 billion, from which  TL&nbsp;883 million was derived as average demand deposits.

<p>Ziraat Bank  will keep building on its relationships with its corporate and commercial  customers in the coming years by offering high quality service and modern  products within the scope of cash management modules.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Retail Banking</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing transformation in Retail Banking </strong><br />
	On the back  of the change and transformation program initiated in December 2011, Ziraat  Bank set it as its main strategy to be an innovative and pioneering bank that  better analyzes customers&rsquo; needs, that stands closer to its customers and that  creates more value.</p>
<p>In this  framework, in 2012 the Bank reengineered its service model also in retail  banking, which is the main building block of change and transformation, on the  aspects of customer, product, channel, organization, process and technology,  human resources and location.<br />
	<br />
	Structuring  efforts have been carried out on many different axes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Branches  have been redesigned with respect to corporate identity, interior architecture,  technology, human resources and behavior codes so as to be aligned with  strategic goals;</li>
	<li>A  substantial portion of retail banking activities have been centralized in  keeping with the targets of alleviating the workload of branches and reducing  transaction costs so as to ensure increased productivity;</li>
	<li>Marketing  and operations units at branches were separated, thus moving to portfolio  structure;</li>
	<li>The  concept of customer ownership was created, which represented a major  breakthrough in customer relationship management.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	One of the  crucial steps of the operational transformation in retail banking was the  revised credit management and performance management process in 2012.</p>
<p>In this  framework, lending processes have been revised and credit and financial  analysis systems have been developed that will provide more efficient and more  dynamic measurement of the credit risk, including centralized allocation.</p>
<p>On another  hand, the performance management system has also been remade on the basis of  the &ldquo;balanced scorecard&rdquo; approach in unit and individual level to ensure that  the strategies defined within the frame of the change and transformation  program are successfully implemented. As of year-end 2012, the system&rsquo;s  integration has been finalized, and the new performance system was put into  practice in all branches that have completed their transformation from the  start of 2013.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>Within the scope of bancassurance activities, Ziraat Bank maintained its leadership particularly in the life insurance sector in 2012.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leadership in the retail segment</strong><br />
Preserving  its position as the sector&rsquo;s leader in the number of retail customers, Ziraat  Bank offered uninterrupted service all over Turkey to its more than 25 million  customers via its 1,425 retail branches and over 23,000 employees during 2012,  which also saw intensive competition.</p>
<p>In the  retail segment that has 45% share within Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s total loan book, the  credits supplied to retail customers amounted to TL&nbsp;29 billion. Remaining  the sector&rsquo;s leader by a large margin with TL&nbsp;19 billion in consumer loans  extended to over 2 million customers during 2012, Ziraat Bank registered 32%  growth in &ldquo;Salary Advance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deposit Advance&rdquo; products, which are the firsts  of their kinds in the sector and which are intended to fulfill the short-term  needs of customers.</p>
<p>In another  department, the Bank made available TL&nbsp;3.3 billion in loans to 200,000  customers in as short a period of time as 3 months with the &ldquo;Four Seasons Loan  Package&rdquo; designed to cater to all of the basic banking needs of retail  customers in 2012.</p>
<p>Commanding  69% share of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s total deposits, retail banking achieved a magnitude  of TL&nbsp;73 billion during 2012, in line with its strategy of new product  development aligned with customer needs and broad-based deposits. Core deposits  have approximately 70% share of total savings deposits.</p>
<p>In 2012,  Ziraat Bank introduced the &ldquo;Grateful Account&rdquo; which encourages customers who  entrust their savings to Ziraat Bank for a prolonged period of time and rewards  them with higher returns. The implementation was quickly embraced by the  customers and reached a high volume.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  launched &ldquo;Gold Term Deposit Account&rdquo; for those customers who tend to save up in  gold coins and wish to benefit from the advantages of term deposits along with  the value increases in gold for gram equivalent of gold coins of 1000/1000  purity (A02), and gold term deposit accounts accumulate interest with flexible  maturity options.</p>
<p> In an effort  to rechannel the gold coins traditionally &ldquo;kept under the pillows&rdquo; back into  the economic cycle, &ldquo;Gold Time&rdquo; initiative was introduced in 2012, under which  physical gold coins were received by the contracted firm thus allowing them to  be deposited in the customers&rsquo; gold term deposits with the Bank.</p>
<p>Within the  scope of bancassurance activities, Ziraat Bank maintained its leadership  particularly in the life insurance sector in 2012, and its total premium  production topped TL&nbsp;1 billion including the premium volume in the  non-life branches that grows with the special advantages provided to customer  groups.</p>
<p><strong>New methods in lending processes</strong><br />
In order to  offer faster, higher quality and more satisfactory service to its retail loan  customers that make up a large portion of its loan book, Ziraat Bank reviewed  its lending processes and introduced a number of new methods.<br />
Within the  frame of efforts to centrally evaluate retail loan demands by way of scoring  method, the Centralized Allocation went live in May 2012 for the following  purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Attain  uniformity and standardization in the allocation of retail loans, and create an  organized credit extension process,</li>
	<li>Alleviate  the operational load of branches, and create branches focused on marketing and  sales,</li>
	<li>Contribute  to the improvement of asset quality in keeping with the targets of sustainable  profitability and productivity,</li>
	<li>Measure  the credit risk in a healthier and more efficient manner in line with the  enterprise risk appetite,</li>
	<li>Form  a healthy database that will enable diversified marketing and analysis  projections via the Standard Decision Support Mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	Allocation  decisions are started to be made by the Decision Module and the Head Office  Allocation Center.</p>
<p>The  calculations based on the transaction handling times revealed that centralized  transactions provide much higher efficiency as compared to those handled by  branches. As of year-end 2012, almost all of the branches switched to the  centralized allocation structure. It is planned to incorporate the few number  of remaining branches in the system during 2013.</p>
<p>In 2012,  Ziraat Bank extended a total of 1,359,852 retail loans, which were worth  TL&nbsp;12.3 billion.</p>
<p>For the  purpose of linking the retail loans of customers to a new repayment plan that  suits their income and cash flows and/or ensuring smooth recovery through  granting an extension of maturity, a total of 782 retail loan products  amounting to TL&nbsp;15.7 million were restructured during 2012, and 685  customers benefited from restructuring.</p>
