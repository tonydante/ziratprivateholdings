	<p><strong>Outlook for the World Economy</strong></p>
	<p>In 2014, the  US economy started to reap the benefits of its policies; however other  economies such as those in Europe, Japan and China faced some slowdown in  growth. Concerns over global growth came to the forefront in 2014.</p>
	<p>In what was  a packed year in terms of the economic and geopolitical agenda, the year 2014  started with positive expectations for the future. Despite fluctuations in  short term risk perceptions after the Fed started to taper its bond purchases,  the general outlook was not significantly changed. However, general concerns  started to mount, especially in the wake of the increased geopolitical risks in  the first half of the year; at the same time, economic indicators in Europe did  not bear out the expected improvement, and the rate of global growth  decelerated. Oil prices plunged to USD&nbsp;50/bbl in the second half of the  year as supplies were not reduced in response to the decline in demand.  A&nbsp;combination of the progress achieved towards finding alternative  technologies for energy resources, the shale gas boom and concerns for global  growth were instrumental in this sudden and sustained drop in oil prices. Lower  oil prices are, of course, positive for energy importers such as Turkey but  have saddled an additional burden on some emerging economies which are  dependent on oil exports, which have been hit hard by geopolitical  developments.</p>
	<p>The recovery  in the rate of growth in the US economy and the rise in employment in 2014  enabled the country to roll out its plans for the normalization process.  The&nbsp;monetary expansion policy, which had been applied by the Fed since the  beginning of the global crisis, was wound down, and is expected to give way to  the &ldquo;lift-off&rdquo; in the coming period where the Fed will start to gradually hike  interest rates. Shifting expectations regarding the timing of these impending  interest rate hikes have sometimes resulted in market volatility while concerns  such as the deceleration in global growth, geopolitical risks and problems in  Europe remain under the spotlight. Although some central banks, notably the  European Central Bank (ECB) and the Japanese Central Bank, have maintained  their expansionary monetary policies, and a deterioration in global liquidity  conditions is not expected, sensitivity to the US macro-economic data releases  which will have an important bearing on the Fed&rsquo;s interest rate decisions  continues. However, the economic recovery in a country which had been so  seriously affected by the crisis could be considered as an important  development on a global scale.</p>
	<p>European  economies completed the year 2014 with disappointment. While the weakness in  growth continued, economies have struggled with credit mechanisms and problems  related to inflation, which has gradually approached the deflation limit.  Structural problems such as the high rate of unemployment and the levels of  public debt remain issues which need to be resolved. After global concerns  mounted toward the middle of the year and the steps taken previously did not  have the desired impacts, ECB took another step and applied negative deposit  interest rates. Since this action was not sufficiently effective, the ECB  implemented new expansionary actions for the rest of the year and continued to  take measures, in addition to those taken at the beginning of the year,  announcing a monetary expansion program which went beyond expectations.  The&nbsp;ECB cited the deceleration in growth as affecting Europe as well as  the global economy, concerns of a further decrease in inflation due to the  decline in oil prices as the reasons for this move. Clearly, more time is  required before being able to conclude that the European economy is on a path  to normalization.</p>
	<p>Japan exited  its deflationary period thanks to expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.  However, the country faces recession risk as a result of economic inertia. High  public debt stock and inflation&rsquo;s inclination to decrease are the issues for  which precautions should be taken. The&nbsp;Government restored trust through  elections held within the year and postponed its plan to raise sales taxes  again. Efforts are in place to lead the Japanese economy through communication  policies regarding the increasing the volume of monetary expansion and spending.</p>
	<p>Developments  in the global economy have a pronounced impact on developing countries.  In&nbsp;contrast with previous years, there was a noticeable decoupling between  these countries. Although geopolitical risks affect all developing countries,  those countries geographically closer to the zones of tensions were affected  more. Furthermore, while the plunge in oil prices was problematical for oil  exporters such as Russia and Brazil, oil importing countries such as Turkey and  India benefited from this development. Russia, in particular, paid a heavy toll  due to its problems with Ukraine, the sanctions that were imposed on the  country and the movements in oil prices. The&nbsp;Russian Rouble plummeted in  value, the country&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves declined, bond yields rose and  the economy started to contract. The&nbsp;decoupling is expected to continue in  the coming period. This environment is expected to provide a suitable backdrop  for structural reforms, especially for energy importing countries which will  benefit from an easing in problems such as the current account deficit.</p>
	<p>China,  providing the most significant contribution to global growth, was not immune to  the problems in the global economy. The&nbsp;country&rsquo;s growth rate dipped to  its long term trend rate to come in at 7.4% in 2014. The&nbsp;Chinese  government has sought to stimulate the economy by lowering policy rates and  introducing measures aimed at promoting spending.</p>

	<p><strong>Outlook for the Turkish Economy</strong> </p>
	<p>Along with  other developing countries, Turkey was exposed to the impacts of global  economic developments in 2014. The&nbsp;rate of growth in the Turkish economy  declined as a result of the developments in surrounding countries, the  macro-prudential measures which were introduced, tight fiscal conditions and  weak global demand.</p>
	<p>Turkish  economy had grown on the back of rising domestic demand in 2013, leading to a  widening in the current account deficit. As we enter 2014, domestic demand came  under pressure with the macro-prudential policies taken to prevent this  situation and an export driven growth trend started on the back of the improved  external conditions. This manifested itself in the first quarter of the year in  the form of a brisk pace of growth in corporate and entrepreneurial loans,  despite a decline in the issue of retail loans and robust exports, especially  to Europe and Middle East. In&nbsp;the second half of the year, though, a  cocktail of problems including heightened geopolitical tensions, disappointment  regarding the economic recovery in Europe and problems in Russia and the Middle  East necessitated a downward revision in expectations. Another issue was the  dashed hopes over inflation, due to the drought.</p>
	<p>Uncertainty  over global monetary topped the list of concerns at the beginning of 2014.  Pricing of financial assets reached record high levels; however all countries  responded to this by taking necessary measures through monetary policies.  The&nbsp;Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) also took necessary  steps and further tightened its monetary policy. The&nbsp;CBRT started the new  year with interest rate hikes and could curbed volatility through liquidity  implementation. In&nbsp;the second half of the year, CBRT cut interest rates to  a limited extent on the back of the improvement in conditions. Although risk  perceptions exhibited a more positive trend than in the previous year, the CPI  was well above expectations due to the increased food prices inflation after  the dry winter. After the sharp plunge in oil prices and a slow normalization  in food prices, the rate of CPI inflation ended the year at 8.17%, which was in  fact lower than the CBRT&rsquo;s own expectation of 8.9%.</p>
	<p>The current  account deficit tended to narrow in 2014, and approached the target set out in  the Medium Term Program of USD&nbsp;46 billion on the back of the slowdown in  imports and the rise in exports, along with the windfall of falling energy  costs, especially in the last quarter of the year. The&nbsp;general consensus  of expectations is that oil prices will remain near their current levels for  some time. With these expectations, a further improvement in the balance of  payments is likely in 2015.</p>
	<p>The  elections held in 2014 did not lead to any deviation from the determined and  disciplined implementation of fiscal policies, and the fiscal performance  continued to improve. There are no concerns regarding the attainment of the  target budget deficit to GDP ratio, which stands at 1.4% in the Medium Term  Program for 2014. A&nbsp;more challenging budget deficit of 1.1% of GDP is  targeted for 2015. This indicates that the steady fiscal management will be  maintained going forward.</p>
	<p>Central Bank  continues its flexible but tight monetary policies in line with developments in  the global economy. Central Bank has sought to achieve this by using multiple  tools. The&nbsp;main monetary policy tools are the policy rate and the interest  rate corridor. These two tools have ensured that the Central Bank has been able  to maintain a tight monetary policy while decreasing interest rates.  The&nbsp;impact of the 550 basis point interest rate hike, implemented in response  to the volatility seen at the beginning of 2014, was effective in reducing the  level of volatility.</p>
	<p>An  improvement in conditions later in the year set the stage for 175 basis points  in rate cuts in the second half of the year. However, with inflation well above  the targets, the Central Bank turned its focus to price stability in its  policies and called a halt on its interest rate cuts. A&nbsp;fall in inflation  expected is expected going forward, especially in the first half of 2015,  following the decrease in energy prices, normalization of food prices and the  contribution from the base effect, which will leave the Central Bank more  comfortable. The&nbsp;CBRT already started gradual rate cuts without deviating  from its tight monetary policy at the beginning of 2015.</p>
	<p>The trend in  oil prices, and the opportunities as well as the challenges that will arise  from this deserve a special mention in an evaluation of 2014. Oil prices have  been declining, especially in the last six-month period, due to a combination  of factors, including the continuous increase in energy efficiency, weakness in  demand as a result of weak global economic growth, no cuts in supply and  producers&rsquo; fears of losing market share. At this juncture, oil exporters will  face problems such as reduced oil revenues and, consequently, a slowdown in  growth rates. On&nbsp;the other hand, energy importers currently struggling  with chronic problems such as current account deficits and inflation will reap  the benefit of lower oil prices. Domestic demand is expected to recover in  Turkey in 2015. While this may negatively affect the current account deficit,  this will be offset by the decrease in the energy bill. Likewise, the windfall  of lower oil prices will also be observed on inflation. With inflation already  on a downtrend and helped by the base effect, it would not come as a surprise  to see inflation decline to the CBRT&rsquo;s target of 5.5%, which is below the 6.3%  target for 2015 set out in the Medium Term Program.</p>
	<p>In short,  the level of oil prices at the end of 2014 is a welcome development for Turkey.  Clearly it will bring benefits to Turkey&rsquo;s macro-economic indicators such as  the current account deficit, inflation and growth. This creates an opportunity  for Turkey to realize structural reforms. The&nbsp;expectations for 2015 are  positive within a general framework. However, structural solutions should be  implemented for gains to be permanent. Measures which are spread to a wide  perspective are shared with the public through the &ldquo;Preferential Transformation  Program Action Plans&rdquo; and the importance placed on this issue is frequently  mentioned. The&nbsp;steps that have started to be taken will provide permanent,  steady, sustainable growth and a macro framework which is compatible with this  by creating permanent benefits in the medium and long term. </p>
	<p><strong>Developments in the Banking Sector</strong></p>
	<p>The banking  sector maintained its growth trend in 2014, significantly contributing to  Turkey&rsquo;s economic growth.</p>
	<p>The Turkish  Banking Sector recorded a more moderate rate of growth due to the measures taken  in the first half of 2014 by the BRSA and CBRT, which curbed domestic demand,  along with the monetary policies implemented by the Fed and ECB, the  devaluation of TL and uncertainties ahead of the election. In&nbsp;the second  half of the year, domestic demand did exhibit some improvement in the wake of  the CBRT&rsquo;s interest rate cuts and the easing in political uncertainties.  The&nbsp;banking sector posted 15% growth in 2014.</p>
	<p>Loans  remained the most important item on the sector&rsquo;s balance sheet, increasing by  18% YoY. In&nbsp;particular, there was tough competition in the corporate  segment; most of the growth was realized in this segment. Regulations aimed at  bringing down the current account deficit set the stage for a healthier  expansion in consumer loans.</p>
	<p>The share of  loans in the sector&rsquo;s total balance sheet increased by 2 percentage points when  compared to the end of 2013 and the deposit/loan ratio approached 120%.</p>
	<p>The sector&rsquo;s  strong shareholder&rsquo;s equity structure was maintained and shareholders&rsquo; equity  grew by 20% in the space of one year. The&nbsp;capital adequacy ratio increased  from 15.3% to 16.3%.</p>
	<p>There was  very little YoY change in the sector&rsquo;s profit in 2014, which came in at  TL&nbsp;24.7 billion. Despite a 14% YoY increase in net interest income, the  sector&rsquo;s net profit did not increase, due to fall in net profit from capital  market transactions and increases in provisions and operating expenses.  The&nbsp;banking sector&rsquo;s return on equity deteriorated by 2 percentage points  to 12.2% when compared to the previous year, while the return on asset  decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 1.7%.</p>
	<p><strong>In 2015…</strong></p>
	<p>The Turkish  Banking Sector operates under a healthy and objective regulation-supervision  function. The&nbsp;sector is expected to maintain its contribution to economic  activity and growth, sustaining its strength in terms of asset quality and  sound capital structure, maintaining a broadly similar general risk profile.  However, in a negative scenario, companies may struggle to pay their debts back  in line with developments in external conjuncture and faltering economic  growth. But the increase in non-performing loans is expected to remain within  reasonable and manageable limits.</p>
	<p>In 2015, the  sector&rsquo;s total asset size is expected to grow by 15-16%, with loan volume  growing by 16-20% and deposits posting growth of 12-14%. The&nbsp;weak trend in  banks&rsquo; profitability seen in 2014 is expected to continue, albeit at a slower  pace, with the sector projected to post an increase of around 8-12% in its net  profit.</p>
