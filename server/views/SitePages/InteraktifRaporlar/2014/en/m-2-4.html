	<p><strong>Activities in 2014</strong></p>
	<p>Our Bank is operating in  a highly competitive sector, which includes international capital. Our Bank  carries forward its position of being the strongest national bank. Our Bank maintained  its civilized human resources policies in 2014, with the awareness of its  success, including its unique position in the sector, unrivaled market  knowledge, ability to serve its customers at the right time, through the right  channel and with the right value propositions.</p>
	<p>Within the scope of  Competency Based Performance Management activities, the Bank almost completed  followings as of 2014 year-end: competency definitions on the basis of duty  position and unit; design and software of evaluations system.</p>
	<p>The Bank switched to the  systematic application for remuneration in 2014. Within this scope, the  following activities have been carried out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Notifications regarding overtime can be performed through the  system thanks to Working after Office Hours Notification/Reporting application  which was started to be used in April. This application also enabled the Bank  to transiently check the reasons why personnel work overtime. By doing so,  actions to minimize working overtime are taken. Within this scope, share of  personnel who work overtime in total staff decreased to 1.6% in 2014.</li>
		<li>Daily Allowance module was created on Finart system to finalize  daily allowance transactions quickly and in a standard manner. This module was  made available to all personnel in June. By doing so, standardization was  provided without making manual operations and payments are carried out to  personnel automatically without any delay.</li>
		<li>An E-payroll system was opened in July 2014. Employees may  monitor their payroll details with their passwords through this system. Thanks  to this system, salaries are calculated automatically without the need for  manual intervention and legal notifications can easily be made.</li>
		<li>Within the framework of transformation activities for increasing  synergy in the Ziraat Finance Group and to increase the effectiveness of units  located abroad, following activities were almost completed in 2014:  personnel-position matching, salary system and revising other personal  regarding units that are located abroad. Activities for updating HR legislation  are planned to continue in 2015.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Negotiations between the  Bank and the Öz Finans – İş Trade Union which was founded on 23&nbsp;August  2013 and which was authorized to make Collective Labor Agreement with the Bank  on 9&nbsp;September 2014 were finalized as of 31&nbsp;December 2014. The&nbsp;Collective  Labor Agreement was signed for the first time in the history of Ziraat Bank.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank Personal Performance Bonus System</strong></p>
	<p>A new bonus system which  was implemented in 2013 in accordance with the Bank&rsquo;s new organizational  structure and strategy which is focused on marketing and sales was designed in  line with the increasing gain principle, which rewards increasing performance  and efficiency, providing higher compensation for those with a higher  performance. Through personal performance evaluations, bonus payments were made  in accordance with performance with the aim of strengthening the customer  focused business model, deepening the marketing and efficiency focused work  approach by motivating employees, increasing their corporate loyalty and  rewarding personal success.</p>
	<p>In the scope of this  implementation, considering our Bank&rsquo;s profitability and operational results in  2014, the bonus budget was determined not to extend 8% of total monthly wage  payments. These payments were determined according to substantial and numerically  measurable criteria, and paid to the employees pertaining to three month  periods beginning from February, May, August, and November. Bonus payments were  designed to provide additional payments to those who had achieved a higher  performance on a marketing basis and on the basis of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Branch segment and scale group,</li>
		<li>Ordering according to performance ration cards, as a result of  measurable performances at the end of three months period,</li>
		<li>Performance bonuses were distributed according to coefficients.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Different coefficients  are applied in the calculation of bonuses according to branch segment, scale,  and personal performance ordering and duty position. Premium which  differentiates in line with performance notes at each pie is calculated for  marketing staff with new amendment made as of 3rd quarter of 2014.  As of the 4th quarter of 2014 The Bank started to calculate premium  to counter staff through the performance of the counter that she/he is  responsible.</p>
	<p>As in other banks, a  performance bonus system was designed for rewarding higher performance and  increasing the efficiency of sales employees. In&nbsp;addition, employees  working in the operations departments of the branches and the general  directorate could benefit from this implementation.</p>
	<p><strong>2015 Projections</strong></p>

	<p>In addition to promotions  regarding title, our Bank enriches career opportunities through promotion.  In&nbsp;this scope, implementation of the &ldquo;Competence Evaluation System&rdquo; has  been planned in order to evaluate our employees&rsquo; performance in terms of their  competence in their duties.</p>
	<p>Within the scope of  Management Trainee Program, personnel who are in Authorized position and who  will be successful as a result of programs that will be held in 2015 will  continue to be assigned to Branch Management/Management within the limits of  needs.<br />
		Within the scope of  activities for receiving demand and opinions regarding &ldquo;Personnel Position and  Location Change&rdquo;, Ziraat Bank will continue to evaluate personnel&rsquo; transfer  demand as of June-July and December-January periods.</p>
