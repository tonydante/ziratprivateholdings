<p>In 2013, the monetary  policies pursued by developed countries&rsquo; central Banks continued to have a  decisive impact on global financial markets, as in previous years. The&nbsp;US  economy has progressed to a stronger position, while despite some glimmers of  hope from the Euro-zone, economic activity in the continent remains weak. High  unemployment rates, as well as difficulties in the loan transfer mechanism are  the main challenges facing the Euro-zone&rsquo;s economic outlook.</p>
<p>Expansionary monetary  policies, which were applied by main central banks in an effort to prevent a  deepening of the global economic crisis, are expected to be wound down once  economic activity recovers. As a matter of fact, the Fed gave the first signals  of this by tapering the size of the bond-buying program.</p>
<p> Even though the liquidity  pumped in to the economy is to be reduced slightly, the low-interest rate  stance will be maintained for some time yet.</p>
<p>In the medium to long  run, we could see interest rate hikes as central banks grapple with the  inflationary pressures brought about by the applied expansionary monetary  policies. However, provided there are no threats on the inflationary front,  keeping interest rates low would be a rational strategy in supporting global  economic activity.</p>
<p>As a result of this new  change in direction initiated by the US, there was some volatility in global  risk appetite since the second quarter of the year, which has been reflected to  emerging markets in the form of instability in short-term capital flows. </p>
<p> In the post- crisis  period, there was something of a slowdown in the growth momentum in emerging  markets, which are the driving force of the global economy. In&nbsp;the global  arena, all financial assets have been repriced, emerging markets have seen  their currencies depreciate and bond rates have increased. Even though  questions still remain over how many years it will take, there will be a  gradual shift from the global environment of abundant and cheap liquidity to  one of contracting government balance sheets. </p>

<p class="solhilite">

<br />
The pioneer of banking in Turkey, Ziraat Bank's approach to effective and productive balance sheet management continued to support its sound growth and development in 2013. <br /><br /><br />
Monetary policies being adhered to by developed countries' central banks continued to determine the course of global financial markets in 2013.
<br /><br /><br />
Successful and disciplined fiscal management gives our country a significant advantage in coping with external-factor fragilities.
<br /><br /><br />
Celebrating the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its founding, 2013 was a special year for Ziraat Bank.
</p>

<p>In an effort to ensure a  smooth landing for the Turkish economy, and to engender a more healthy and  balanced structure, a number of measures were applied in Turkey in the previous  year, paving the way for a sound performance in 2013 as well. Economic growth  gained pace in 2013 and domestic-demand driven growth dynamics were observed,  which shaped the economic policies applied by the Central Bank and other  authorities responsible for the economy. However, domestic demand driven growth  exposed the pressure on the current account deficit and inflation. Besides,  mounting uncertainty over global monetary policies from the second half of 2013  precipitated a wave of capital out-flows from emerging markets, including  Turkey. The&nbsp;weakness in global economic growth and volatility in risk  appetite in the financial markets will remain key risks in the upcoming period. </p>
<p>Towards the end of the  year, the depreciation in the TL and hikes in interest rates started to have a  small impact on macroeconomic data. In&nbsp;particular, the depreciation of the  TL caused inflation to exceed projections. Fluctuations in unprocessed food  prices during the year also affected inflation, which ended the year at an  annual rate of 7.4%. </p>
<p>During periods of  increased fluctuations in short-term capital movements, the balance of payments  statistics becomes one of the closely monitored macroeconomic variables. A  combination of buoyant economic activity and a hike in import demand worsened  the current account deficit in 2013. The&nbsp;current account deficit as a  ratio of GDP exceeded the level that was projected in the medium term program.  In&nbsp;the coming period, however, the current account deficit is expected to  narrow on the back of slowing economic activity, decreasing import demand and a  positive contribution of exports thanks to the continued recovery in Euro-zone  economies. </p>
<p>Taking into account the  vulnerabilities caused by external factors, we can conclude that Turkey stands  out with its advantageous position and successful and disciplined fiscal  management. The&nbsp;2014 budget and Medium-Term Program demonstrate that there  will be no deviation from the successful fiscal policies that have been  applied. </p>
<p>The Central Bank of  Turkey has continuously applied monetary policies aimed at limiting  fluctuations in the TL, preventing possible speculation in the TL and easing  any deterioration in inflationary expectations.</p>
<p>The Turkish banking  sector maintains its stable and healthy growth. The&nbsp;annual rate of growth  in the combined balance sheet of the sector reached 26%, while the continued  growth in loans stands as an indicator of the support extended to the real  sector. The&nbsp;sector continues to support the economy through its high-quality  assets and liabilities structure and sound equity level.</p>
<p>As the pioneer in the  banking sector, Ziraat Bank maintained its healthy development in 2013, thanks  to its efficient and effective balance sheet management approach. The&nbsp;year  2013 has been a special one for our Bank, marked by the celebrations of its 150<sup>th</sup>  anniversary. In&nbsp;view of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s value-adding innovation around the  principle of &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo; and the significant progress it has  taken towards its transformation, as well as its presence as a pioneering bank  for the agricultural sector in its 150<sup>th</sup> year of its operation, the  Bank will sustain its vision of &ldquo;being everybody&rsquo;s bank&rdquo;. Our Bank, which has  maintained a devotion to social responsibility for 150 years and which adds value  to the economy, is rapidly becoming brand well-known throughout the world.</p>
