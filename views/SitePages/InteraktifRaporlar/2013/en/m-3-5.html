<p class="baslik">Risk Management Policies in Accordance to Risk Type</p>

<div id="midpanel">
	<p>The  fundamental approach to risk management is to achieve the best possible  practices in risk management functions by instilling a culture of  risk-awareness throughout the Bank and by continuously improving both the  system and the Bank&rsquo;s human resources.</p>
	<p>Risk  management activities cover the primary headings of credit risk, market risk,  operational risk and balance sheet risk. Policy and implementation principles  concerning the management of these risks are carried out in accordance with the  regulations on the basis of each type of risk, which are approved by the Board  of Directors. The&nbsp;utmost attention is taken to ensure that the risk  management activities which take place are conducted with the coordinated  participation of all units that are involved in every activity associated with  the risk categories.</p>
	<p>In  order to establish a system to determine the capital level and the need for  capital against the risks that the Bank is exposed to (or will be exposed to),  an Internal Capital Adequacy Evaluation Process is established in our Bank, in  line with strategic goals, within the framework of the &ldquo;Regulation on the Internal  Systems of the Banks&rdquo;, which was enacted after publication in the Official  Gazette, issue 28337, dated 28&nbsp;June 2012. The&nbsp;analyses, which are in  compliance with the implementation guidelines of the BRSA, are supported with  stress testing and scenario analyses on a risk basis.</p>
	<p>Under  the scope of &ldquo;Regulation on Equity of Banks&rdquo;, &ldquo;Regulation on Measurement and  Evaluation of Leverage Level of Banks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Regulation on Capital Maintenance  and Cyclical Capital Buffer&rdquo;, which were enacted in 2013, studies are conducted  in alignment with Basel III Regulations.</p>
	<p>In  accordance with the Basel-III liquidity implementations, a &ldquo;liquidity coverage  ratio quantitative impact study&rdquo; is carried out in line with the &ldquo;Regulation on  Measurement and Evaluation of Liquidity Adequacy of Banks&rdquo; which was published  by the BRSA. Additionally, studies related to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and  Net Stable Funding Rate are delivered to the Basel Committee in 6-month periods  through the BRSA. </p>
	<p><strong>Credit Risk</strong></p>
	<p>Credit  risk management involves regulating the Bank&rsquo;s credit risk exposure and  defining, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting these risks.</p>
	<p>The  process of statutory reporting in compliance with the Basel II Standard  Approach that began as of 1&nbsp;July 2012 as prescribed by the Basel II rules  published on 28&nbsp;June 2012 continued in 2013 as well. Accordingly, the  amount of credit risk which is calculated is reported to the BRSA monthly on a  solo basis and quarterly on a consolidated basis.</p>
	<p>The  Bank established the Company Assessment Model so that related units are able to  determine the creditworthiness of customers in the Commercial, Corporate and  Entrepreneurial segments, and the Scoring Model for establishing the  creditworthiness of its customers in the Retail segment. Validation is carried  out to measure the accuracy and performance of these models using statistical  methods. In&nbsp;order to also allow the use of advanced measurement methods to  calculate the amount of credit risk, work is carried out on the results of the  said scoring models.</p>
	<p>Credit  risk limits, which are approved by the Board of Directors, have been determined  on the basis of customer segments; these limits are monitored on a monthly  basis and the risk-weighted assets that the Bank is able to carry on the basis of  segments are restricted with these limits.</p>
	<p><strong>Market Risk</strong><strong> </strong></p>
	<p>With  a view to revealing the market risks that the Bank may be exposed to, risk  measuring and monitoring are carried out, the results of which are taken into  consideration in the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making process.</p>
	<p>In  the market risk control process, the market developments that affect the  current values of &ldquo;portfolios subject to market risk&rdquo;, which is determined in  line with the Bank&rsquo;s trading strategy, are monitored at least on a daily basis,  and the impact of ordinary or extraordinary downward and upward moves in the  markets on the portfolio is analyzed.</p>
	<p>In an attempt to prevent  the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength from being significantly affected by increased  volatility in the markets in the course of its day-to-day activities, signal  values in the early warning system are monitored and risk levels are restricted  within limits.	</p>
	<p>The  amount of market risk to be included in the legal capital adequacy ratio is  calculated and reported by using the standardized method. The&nbsp;market risk  is measured on a daily basis using the VaR-based internal method employed in  addition to the standardized method, which has been assessed and endorsed for  suitability within the framework of international best practices by an  independent consultancy firm.</p>
	<p><strong>Operational Risk</strong><strong> </strong></p>
	<p>Operational  risks incurred throughout the Bank are tracked by means of the Operational Risk  Loss Data Base. The&nbsp;amount of capital required to cover operational risks  is calculated according to the Basic Indicator Approach.</p>
	<p>Our  Bank initiated work to set up the integrated risk mainframe within the scope of  COBIT. A database of Information Technology risks was set up, through which the  risks that were found and the actions taken to tackle them are monitored.</p>
	<p>Our  Bank&rsquo;s Business Continuity Plan has been revised and a &ldquo;Business Impact  Analysis&rdquo; was conducted which evaluated probable risks that could be caused by  potential interruptions in operations and their potential impacts.</p>
	<p>To  ensure a continuity of services obtained from companies to which support  services are outsourced, the Bank started assessing the risks that might arise  from service procurement within the scope of the Regulation on the Outsourcing  of Support Services by Banks published by the BRSA.</p>
	<p>An  Operational Risk Map has been prepared for use in the Internal Control audit  program for the purpose of establishing the risk levels of the Bank&rsquo;s branches.</p>
	<p><strong>Balance Sheet Risks</strong><strong> </strong></p>
	<p>To  reveal the liquidity risk and the interest rate risks arising from banking  accounts that the Bank may be exposed to, risk measurement and monitoring are  carried out, the results of which are taken into consideration in the Bank&rsquo;s  strategic decision-making process.</p>
	<p>Compliance  with statutorily-mandated ratios pertaining to the interest rate risk incurred  on liquidity and banking institutional accounts is monitored. In&nbsp;addition,  equivalent primary liquid reserve levels that will allow the Bank to pursue its  normal day-to-day activities as well as CBRT liquidity facilities that can be  used to fulfill unexpected liquidity needs and secondary reserves that have the  potential to be liquidated with low price risk; monitoring borrowing facilities  from organized markets and thus tracking free capital levels. In&nbsp;addition,  scenario and sensitivity analyses are carried out within this framework.</p>
	<p>In  interest rate risk control of banking accounts, analyses and monitoring are  carried out on ratio and maturity mismatches between fixed and variable interest  rate funds and placements, as well as in behavioral finance and contractual  maturities of assets and liabilities, and into the effects that probable  downward or upward changes in interest rates, either ordinary or extraordinary,  will have on the current value of the assets or liabilities. Turkish lira and  foreign currency interest margins are also watched closely.</p>
	<p>In order to prevent our  financial strength from being significantly affected by increased volatility in  the markets and potential mismatches in cash inflows and outflows during the  course of our day-to-day activities, signal values in the early warning system  are monitored and risk levels are restricted within limits.</p>
