<p class="baslik">Audit Committee's Assessment of the Operation of the Internal Audit, Internal Control, and Risk Management Systems</p>

<div id="midpanel">
	<p>The internal  audit, internal control and risk management activities at Ziraat Bank are carried  out by the Board of Auditors and Internal Control and Risk Management Group,  which have segregated duties and responsibilities, are organizationally  independent from each other, but work in coordination.</p>
	<p>Set up to  cover all units, branches and the Bank’s subsidiaries subject to audit, the  organization aims to ensure complete and secure pursuance of banking  activities, realization of long-term profit targets, reliable financial and  administrative reporting, and minimization of unexpected risks that might  negatively affect the Bank’s reputation and financial stability.</p>
	<p><strong>OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT  SYSTEM</strong></p>
	<p>The Board of  Auditors adopts a risk-focused approach to auditing and monitors the compliance  of the activities carried out by all of the Bank’s head office units, domestic  and international branches, and subsidiaries under its control with the law and  other applicable legislation, as well as the Bank’s internal strategy, policy,  principles and targets, including internal control and risk management. The&nbsp;Board  of Auditors keeps the Bank’s Senior Management informed and pursues its efforts  in a manner to contribute to the decision-making processes of the Senior  Management.</p>
	<p>Having 167  members and working in line with the international internal audit standards, in  2013 the Board of Auditors audited and evaluated the effectiveness and  efficiency of transaction steps that make up the primary processes, and the  secondary processes, besides auditing the compliance of the Bank’s activities  with the processes that they are governed under. In&nbsp;addition, the Bank’s  IT Inspectors audited the processes set out in the Regulation on Bank  Information Systems and Banking Processes published by the Banking Regulation  and Supervision Agency (BRSA) in line with the Bank’s implementations.</p>
	<p>In addition  to the on-site audits that are conducted using the reporting structure  integrated into the Bank’s system, the Centralized Audit Team, which operates  under the Board of Auditors and plays a key role by applying various scenario analyses  to identify realized irregularities and by producing a dissuasive effect on  possible irregularities in order to prevent them, thus continues to increase  its contributions to the activities of the Board of Auditors.</p>
	<p>In addition,  members of the Board of Auditors strived to build up the personnel’s practical  knowledge through on-site training sessions provided in the branches in 2013.  At the same time, the inspectors have the opportunity to conduct audit in  different units periodically and thereby constantly build on their professional  knowledge and experience; they were also given training at certain intervals to  support their personal and professional development. In&nbsp;this context, in  2013 the Bank continued to implement the training catalogue, which is  formulated by identifying the training programs for each member of the Board of  Auditors of all seniority levels, and opportunities were created for members of  the Board of Auditors to take part in numerous external (outside the Bank)  meetings, conferences and workshops during the reporting period. </p>
	<p>Having made  it a principle and a goal to contribute significantly to the Bank’s qualified  and high-quality human resources, the Board of Auditors provided an intensive  transition of its members to administrative duties during 2013; hence, the  Bank’s experienced members who have been involved in the examination and  inspection of the Bank’s various domestic and international branches, regional  offices and Head Office units continued to offer administrative services to our  Bank’s different units in various regions. On the other hand, the recruitment  process for 41 assistant inspectors was completed in January 2013, and the  individuals started working in their new posts.</p>
	<p>The Board of  Inspectors continues to evaluate the organizational changes at the Bank, the  modules introduced in lending decisions and the systematic differences arising  from the launch of centralized allocation structures, and the Operations  Center, and continues to work on the New Auditing Model.</p>
	<p>In the  coming period, the Board of Auditors will continue to be guided by a high sense  of responsibility and duty in the execution of the internal audit plan to be  devised in line with the targets and policies determined by the Bank’s Senior  Management and within the framework of the modern approach to auditing; in the  reporting of their outcomes to the Board of Directors through the Audit  Committee and in monitoring the precautions to be adopted based on audit  reports.</p>
	<p> <strong>OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM</strong></p>
	<p>Internal  control activities are organized in such a way to cover the activities of the  Bank’s domestic and international branches, regional directorates and head  office units under the Regulation on Banks’ Internal Systems issued by the  BRSA, and are constantly revised in line with the Bank’s requirements.</p>
	<p>The scope  and implementation of the approach are in line with the Bank’s main goals and  strategies. After the change in risk perceptions and a new service model  implementation, a proactive structure is adopted in accordance with the changes  in the strategy and circumstances. Thanks to this adopted proactive structure,  the Bank’s operations are performed at higher standards than the sector norms  in accordance with both domestic and international codes and competitive  conditions. </p>
	<p>Internal  control programs are enforced upon approval from our Committee. Controls are  carried out on an average of 840 branches each quarter within the scope of the  program, within the framework of the branches’ risk map prepared by the risk  management department.</p>
	<p>Internal  control activities at all of our international branches are conducted in  accordance with the annual control plans that are approved by our Committee.</p>
	<p>The control  intervals at head office units are determined in view of the units’ functions  and risk exposure, their job descriptions and their impact on the Bank’s  balance sheet, and are revised in line with the Bank’s needs.</p>
	<p>The findings  contained in the reports prepared following these activities are categorized  under certain headings, and are shared with relevant units and the Senior  Management.</p>
	<p>In 2013,  on-site Internal Controllers continued to conduct examinations regarding  matters established during the control activities and which were deemed to require  further examination. The&nbsp;necessary action to be taken by the Bank based on  the preliminary examination reports was taken and transactions which were  suspected of being subject to abuse were shared with the Board of Auditors in  order to ensure that the necessary examinations/investigations were undertaken.</p>
	<p>In addition  to the above, compliance control activities are also carried out by the  internal control function within the framework of Article 18 of the Regulation  on the Banks’ Internal Systems. Accordingly, all past or planned activities of  the Bank, as well as new products and transactions are checked for compliance  with the Law and other applicable legislation, internal policies and  guidelines, and established banking practices. Furthermore, regulations that  are issued or modified by the Bank are also reviewed within the scope of  compliance controls and resulting opinions are shared with the related units.</p>
	<p>Besides  control activities, recommendation reports continued to be issued, which are  aimed at improving the processes related to the activities carried out at the  Bank by Internal Controllers and at prevention of possible risks.  The&nbsp;objectives of this implementation are to prevent risks by identifying  them in advance, improving processes so as to achieve alignment with the  competitive environment and customer satisfaction, and taking cost-saving  measures.</p>
	<p>Internal  Controllers are encouraged to take on administrative duties; accordingly, 19  Internal Controllers were transferred to administrative positions during 2013,  thus continuing to supply qualified human resources to the Bank’s  administrative personnel. In&nbsp;addition, the decision was taken to hire 36  assistant internal controllers from outside the Bank to be trained to replace  the internal controllers who had been transferred to administrative duties, and  to sustain the dynamic nature of the internal controller staff.</p>
	<p><strong>OPERATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong></p>
	<p>The  fundamental approach to risk management activities carried out at the Bank is  to achieve the best possible practices in risk management functions by  inculcating a culture of risk-awareness throughout the Bank and by continuously  improving both the system and the human resources. The&nbsp;utmost attention is  taken towards ensuring that the risk management activities undertaken are  conducted with the coordinated participation of all units that are involved in  every activity associated with each category of risk. Risk management  activities cover the main headings of credit risk, market risk, operational  risk and balance sheet risks (interest rate risk arising from banking accounts  and liquidity risk), and have the ultimate objective of achieving compliance  with international best practices.</p>
	<p>Under  credit risk management activities, work is undertaken to define, measure,  monitor and report credit risk, employing methods that are in alignment with  Basel II. In&nbsp;this context, legal reporting process started using the Basel  II Standardized Method from 1&nbsp;July 2012. The&nbsp;amount of credit risk is  reported to the BRSA each month on a solo basis and quarterly on a consolidated  basis. Efforts are ongoing at the Bank to measure the creditworthiness in  connection with advanced measurement methods. Accordingly, work is being  carried out on the outcomes of scoring models used for different loan  portfolios. Validation is carried out using statistical methods to measure the  accuracy and performance of these scoring models. Furthermore, credit risk  limits that are approved by the Board of Directors are monitored, and work is  in progress to conduct scenario analyses and stress testing for the non-performing  loans ratio. Methods that are in alignment with Basel III have been prepared  and will be implemented in the new operational year.</p>
	<p>Under  the operational risk management activities, operational risks are defined,  classified, measured and analyzed. The&nbsp;operational risk loss database in  the Finart environment allows incidents of operational risk to be tracked.  Risks arising from information technology and actions taken are followed up. An  Operational Risk Map is being prepared for use in the Internal Control audit  program for the purpose of establishing the risk levels of the Bank’s branches.  In&nbsp;addition, risk exposure assessments are conducted for companies  providing outsourced support services within the framework of the BRSA’s  regulations in force. </p>
	<p>Within  the scope of market and balance sheet risk management activities, market risk,  liquidity risk, and interest rate risk arising from banking accounts are  measured, analyzed, limited, reported and monitored, and the analyses conducted  are supported through stress tests.</p>
	<p>To  determine the amount of shareholders’ equity that is aligned with the loss our  Bank may sustain due to its risk exposure, a capital adequacy assessment is  conducted using the economic capital approach and the results are reported to  the senior management.</p>
	<p>The  results of the analyses conducted under risk management activities and the risk  indicators are reported to the Board of Directors and our Committee at six  month intervals, and to the executive units and internal system units at  monthly, weekly and daily intervals.</p>
	<p>The  new operating period will be marked by continued activities under all risk  categories on the basis of internationally accepted advanced risk management  techniques, as well as execution of these activities as an integral part of the  Bank’s strategic decision-making processes.</p>
