<div id="midpanel">
	<p>Celebrating  its 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary year, Ziraat Bank proceeded step by step in  realizing its goals with the dynamism brought by reorganization. Ziraat Bank  has worked intensively towards achieving the Bank&rsquo;s transformation in Service  for Bank Customers model which is shaped by &ldquo;Customer Oriented Banking&rdquo;, with  the underlying motto in this transformation being &ldquo;Together, to a Better  Future&rdquo;. In&nbsp;this respect, Ziraat Bank switched to a portfolio management  system upon completion of customer and branch segmentation, in order to provide  services to customers through accurate channels. The&nbsp;General Management,  Regional and Branch Organization have been restructured in accordance with  principles such as &ldquo;division of powers&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer orientation&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>Branch and  customer segmentation has been carried out in line with the one-to-one Customer  Relationships Management study. Under the framework of customer orientation,  branches have been diversified in order to meet different financial needs of  the customers. The&nbsp;Bank switched to a customer representation model - in  compliance with Portfolio Management principles - and a number of  infrastructural IT projects have been completed in order to allow Bank to  follow-up customer needs. Consequently, Ziraat Bank turned into a bank with the  most extensive network which aims to meet all financial needs of the customers  in a customer centric way.</p>
	<p>Within the  context of the project, the &ldquo;Operations Center&rdquo; was activated and operations  gradually transferred to the Center in order to reduce operational density and  simplify our services. An Individual Performance System started to be employed  in parallel with the objective and transparent HR policies, which are at the  heart of the motto of &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo;. </p>
	<p><br />
		In line with  the &ldquo;Together toward the Target&rdquo; strategy, which marks the second stage of the  reorganization, work on the corporate development projects continued unabated  within Ziraat Bank and corresponding banks and branches abroad.  The&nbsp;primary objective of &ldquo;Together toward the target&rdquo; is to ensure the  transformation of customers from &ldquo;Bank Customers&rdquo; to &ldquo;Ziraat Customers&rdquo;, with  the ultimate goal of ensuring all our partners and international branches  operate efficiently, in compliance with our understanding of global banking  under the &ldquo;Ziraat&rdquo; brand and serve our customers with the same quality of  service in every country, and therefore, turn into a bank with a high brand and  market value which operates on an international scale. </p>
	<p>Infrastructural  IT investments for our international partners and branches are carried out in  alignment with our target, and basic banking systems are renewed. As a  consequence of this work, the Bank became more prepared to tackle the  competition in the sector and the volatility in the markets, and rounded off a  successful performance in 2013, despite the challenges of the instabilities in  the fluctuations. </p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  increased its total assets by 27% YoY to TL&nbsp;207.5 billion by the end of  2013. By re-establishing credit evaluation, allocation, management and risk  appetite by institutionalizing these processes, the Bank achieved a record 55%  increase in total credits and raised its total credit balance to TL&nbsp;111  billion. Consequently, the ratio of credit in total assets was realized as 54%. </p>
	<p>As one of  the country&rsquo;s most important assets, the Bank continued to increase its support  for the real sector. The&nbsp;Bank realized this by strategically placing  itself in the entrepreneurial customer segment, mainly in the SME segment.  Additionally, the Bank is poised to continue adding value to the national  economy by involving itself in investment and project financing operations in  those sectors which are contributing to reducing the current account deficit. </p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  is close to its customers in financing the agricultural sector and considers  the growth and development of the agricultural sector as one of its primary  objectives, helping the sector become competitive on a global scale. Being  involved in every stage of the financing of agricultural production,  agricultural industry and industrial production, the Bank strives for all  players in this value chain, as part of the transformation process. In&nbsp;the  agricultural industry Ziraat Bank is close to the customer in every stage of  the production process from the ground to the shelf, starting from production  right up to the sale and marketing of goods in both domestic and foreign  markets, from the very first product to the end customers of the Bank.  Anticipating that agriculture will be as important as energy as a business  line, the Bank will remain a key supporter of the agricultural sector while  increasing its efficiency and competitiveness.</p>
	<p>Building its  deposit resources on a solid basis, Ziraat Bank continued to fund its assets at  low cost by concentrating on its deposit base in 2013. Deposits, which  accounted for the highest weighting in assets, amounted to TL&nbsp;141.7  billion. The&nbsp;share of demand deposits in total deposits reached around  20%. In&nbsp;order to extend funding maturities, the Bank purchased syndication  loans for USD&nbsp;700 million and placed priority on the issue of domestic  bank bills and bonds during the process of diversification in the structure of  resources.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  completely renewed its Internet Branch. The&nbsp;New Generation Internet Branch  is categorized according to customers&rsquo; various needs and received the Best in  its Class award in the Financial Services category in the Interactive Media  Awards, in view of its accessible homepage and user-friendly structure. This  award, granted to Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s New Generation Internet Branch, was also the  first award given by the IMA to an Internet Branch in Turkey. </p>
	<p>The Bank leads the sector in terms of the number of cards  in circulation, with more than 20 million cardholders. In&nbsp;the framework of  increasing the utilization of debit cards in shopping purposes, the Bank  activated the Bankkart project which provides cash to cardholders whenever they  spend using their Bankkart - the Bank&rsquo;s own brand. The&nbsp;Bankkart was the  first bank card to allow its holders to earn while both spending and saving.</p>
	<p>The Bank opened 150 new branches in its 150<sup>th</sup>  year. The&nbsp;number of ATMs increased by 1,120 in 2013, with 243 added in the  last quarter to reach a total of 5,353, helping the Bank meet customer&rsquo;s  demands more rapidly and efficiently. </p>
	<p>The ratio of equity - amounting to TL&nbsp;18.3  billion - in total liabilities stood at 8.9% at the end of 2013, with our Bank  commanding a capital adequacy ratio of 13.2%. The&nbsp;main constituent of the  equity was the net profit, which was realized as TL&nbsp;3.3 billion in 2013,  placing the Bank as the most profitable bank in the sector. </p>
	<p>Performing  well on the basis of many profitability and efficiency ratios including net  interest margin and capital efficiency, the Bank realizes its aim with a  dedicated project discipline and continues to work to generate value for  customers and the country with its global banking vision and dynamic new  structure.                </p>
