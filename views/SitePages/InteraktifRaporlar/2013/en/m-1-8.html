<p>As  a solution to the global crisis, which erupted  in 2008, the central banks of developed countries applied expansionary monetary  policies, setting the stage for an environment of excess liquidity and low  interest rates, which has been the main feature of the last 5 years. </p>
<p>With the recovery in  developed countries, the global economy is on course to normalize again.  The&nbsp;first step in this process was taken by the Fed, to taper the volume  of its bond-buying program and gradually wind down this process. Although the  decision did not start to be implemented until December, it started to give  rise to volatility in risk perceptions worldwide from the second half of the  year. In&nbsp;the coming period, the question of when the low-interest rate  environment will end - as well as the pace of the tapering - will remain under  the spotlight in the global economy.</p>
<p>Along with the USA,  developments in Europe, Japan and emerging markets will be closely watched.  Even though liquidity is being cut from the US, there are no similar  expectations from the monetary policies in the Euro-zone or Japan. Volatility  in the sphere of global development in 2014 is bound to affect Turkey, as a  result of our country&rsquo;s global integration, in common with the process seen in  other emerging markets. As our economy started to perform better in 2013 when  compared to the previous year, Turkey was affected by the volatility in risk  appetite and short-term capital flows, along with other emerging market  countries. Despite the depreciation of the TL, the increase in interest rates  and downside revisions to growth projections, there are no expectations of a  deterioration in the national macroeconomic performance in the new economic  era, in which assets are in search of new valuations.<br />
	As one of the most  important corporations in the country and in the banking sector, Ziraat Bank  aims to increase the value-added to the country and sustain efficient and  profitable growth on the back of the assets-liability management strategies  which have been applied since 2011 and the &ldquo;value-adding transformation&rdquo;  project, aimed building a customer oriented infrastructure, thus enabling  greater competitiveness in this area.</p>
<p>In this framework, Ziraat  Bank completed its organizational, operational, human resources and loan policy  infrastructure quickly and completely through by internal resources. Aiming to  attain a customer oriented balance sheet in 2013, thanks to loan weighted  growth model assets increased by 27%. With a strategy concentrated on supporting  the real sector, cash loans surged by 55% while non-cash loans increased by  almost 100%. While supporting and helping the development of the agricultural  sector, which is our main mission, we have also sought to increase our focus on  industrial agriculture. In&nbsp;2013, our profit increased by 26% to reach  TL&nbsp;3.3 billion. We deem our stable growth -backed by profitability and efficiency- and our strategy of maintaining a sound balance sheet structure as  factors which help us reflect our profitability into equity. </p>
<p class="solhilite">Ziraat Bank, aiming to attain a customer oriented balance sheet in 2013, increased its assets by 27% thanks to loan weighted growth model.</p>
<p>Deposits  represent our main source of financing. In&nbsp;order to support the savings  balance of the country, we strive to introduce various deposit products for the  use of the customers. In&nbsp;seeking longer term financing and low-cost  opportunities, however, we also work on expanding non-depository financing  resources. Significant increases in the volume of resources obtained from  international corporations and banks, in FX repo transactions, in syndication  loans and, on the domestic front, bank-bonds and bills have been seen as part  of the diversification in our resource structuring strategies. </p>
<p>Our branches were  renovated with a customer focused approach during 2013. A total of 150 new  branches were opened, bringing our overall branch network to 1,661 including  international branches. We aim to increase the number of locations where we are  the sole provider of financial services. Our established operation centers,  that will support efforts to gain operational efficiency, undertook 104 million  transactions. We also work on developing our alternative distribution channels. </p>
<p>We have successfully come  a long way in our domestic restructuring strategy and celebrate our 150<sup>th</sup>  anniversary with pride. In&nbsp;2014 we will also continue to work on; </p>
<ul>
	<li>Restructuring Ziraat Bank’s widespread international  organization, with the aim of being a regional and global bank along with being  the pioneering Bank of Turkey,</li>
	<li>Sustaining the customer focused perspective in the foreign arena  as much as we provide our services to our customers at home and every point of  the country, </li>
	<li>Implementing our corporate principles built under the framework  of economic, social and environmental evolution and values in order to  contribute to shaping a sustainable future and</li>
	<li>To be the best, without being under any delusions of grandeur.</li>
