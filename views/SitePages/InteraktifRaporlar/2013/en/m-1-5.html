<div id="midpanel">

<div class="solhilite">The efforts carried out in 2012 under the project of change and transformation that Ziraat Bank launched under the slogan "Together toward the target", in a bid to bring its deep-seated corporate values to the future have been completed. </div>
<p>More than a  hundred projects, each one unique yet nevertheless compatible with every other  and conducted under 27 main project groups, are all informed by six basic  premises. </p>
<p><strong>Principle 1: One-to-One Customer  Relationship Management</strong></p>
<p>One of the  main goals of the Bank is to build up a sustainable and value enhancing  relationship with its customers, who are the Bank&rsquo;s most valuable asset.  The&nbsp;principle of the shift from a &ldquo;product customer&rdquo; approach to a &ldquo;Bank  customer&rdquo; approach, which started in 2012 and which is targeted to meet this  goal, was successfully carried to higher levels in 2013 as the shift from  &ldquo;product customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;Ziraat customer&rdquo;. Aiming to listen to and understand our  customers&rsquo; financial needs, and accordingly to offer them the right value  propositions, the Bank&rsquo;s infrastructure was updated in terms of structure as  well as systematic bases in 2013. Along this line; </p>
<ul>
	<li>Under  the principles of portfolio management, portfolio management systems were  updated in order to better understand the customers and be able to provide  right value offers to the branch employees.</li>
	<li>Pricing  policies and tools were developed in line with customers&rsquo; needs.</li>
	<li>Apart  from the branches, service channels were revised according to customers&rsquo; needs  in view of their developing financial requirements. The&nbsp;internet branch  was renewed, with new ATMs being provided to customers, while the functional  characteristics of the ATMs and mobile branches were updated. </li>
	<li>In  line with the financial needs of all customer segments, new products were  designed and provided for our customers.</li>
	<li>Available  branch designs were revised to incorporate the new modern banking criteria and  296 branches were integrated to the newly designed customer focused branch  concept.</li>
	<li>Aiming  to offer services at more points, 150 new branches were opened in 45 provinces  in 2013 – the Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> year of operation – four of which service  the entrepreneurial segment. Thus as of end-2013, the Bank continued to create  value for customers operating through 1,636 branches, split as 5 corporate  branches, 27 commercial branches, 81 entrepreneurial branches, 1,521 branches,  and 2 mobile vehicles, and was the sole provider of banking services at 400  locations throughout Turkey.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Corporate Risk  Appetite </strong></p>
<p>The main criteria  of credit risk management at Ziraat Bank can be listed as the effective  transfer of lending policies to the field, the establishment of a shared credit  culture at all branches and the effective monitoring of credit risk.</p>
<p> Within the  framework of the efforts to establish enterprise risk appetite, the Bank  launched major decision support systems in 2012 including the &ldquo;Retail Loans  Assessment Module&rdquo;, the &ldquo;SME Assessment Module&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Company Assessment  Module&rdquo;. In&nbsp;2013, new features were added in order to improve the systems. </p>
<p>To  complement the quick and accurate lending evaluation capability, efficient  monitoring and collection practices were brought into service. </p>
<p>Lending  processes were set up and implemented to bring about more efficient management  of the lending process and to meet customers&rsquo; needs more rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: An Efficient  Information Technology and Operational Infrastructure</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>2013 was an  important year for Ziraat Bank with a number of important steps taken in the  information technology area. </p>
<p>One of the  Bank&rsquo;s main goals in 2013 was to alleviate the operational work load of the  branches, thus creating a structure more oriented towards customer needs. As  such, transactions carried at the operations center, which was opened in 2012,  were diversified and further actions were taken in order to improve workload  management of the branches.</p>
<p>Studies  taken under the aim of bringing about the automation of transactions conducted  at branches, regions and headquarters continued. As a result of these efforts,  2,207 employees were transferred from operational positions and given sales  responsibilities instead in 2012 and 2013. Of this total, 1,172 of the  reassignments were due to improvements in systems and 1,035 were due to  improvements in operations.</p>
<p>The  efficiency boosting processes at the Bank and the efforts to set up quality  management systems will continue in 2014.</p>
<p>In an effort  to efficiently rollout technology, IT infrastructure and facility  transformations are ongoing, aimed at the smooth implementation of all  operations and the securing of cost advantages. As such, all IT equipment at  the end of its useful life has been renewed, while LAN and IP centralization  projects have been implemented and broadened. The&nbsp;measures will be  finalized in the first quarter of 2014. </p>
<p><strong>Principle 4: Objective and  Transparent Human Resources Management</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In  accordance with Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s HR policy which places people at the heart of  what it does, it is of the utmost importance that employees work in positions  which suit their competencies and where they can enjoy job satisfaction. To  this end, the Bank moved from the title based vertical organizational structure  to the job position-based horizontal organizational structure in 2012.  In&nbsp;2013, promotions were awarded on the basis of employees&rsquo; talents and  competency, as well as the results of exams they had taken. Certification  training was also provided to the employees.</p>
<p>Efforts are  in progress to identify the potential of staff and to assess their performance  objectively. The&nbsp;work in relation to the Individual Performance Appraisal  System was completed in 2012 and became available for branch employees to use  in 2013. As part of the empowering of costumer focused business model, the  scope of marketing and efficiency focused working principles will be widened.  In&nbsp;order to increase employee loyalty through motivational methods and  reward individual success in line with corporate targets, the performance  management system will be widened to head office departments. Integration  studies of the head office departments started in 2013 and are expected to be  completed in 2014.</p>
<p>As a matter  of transparency principle, all forms of updating and revision are announced to  all employees. Internal communication channels were introduced in 2012 in the  &ldquo;Together toward the Target&rdquo; project, to keep employees informed of updates and  changes. Through the &ldquo;Together toward the Target&rdquo; sharing platform and weekly  bulletin, employees are able to obtain information regarding projects.  The&nbsp;&ldquo;Together, to the target&rdquo; sharing platform can be accessed through the  Bank&rsquo;s internal information sharing portal. By using this channel, employees  are able to share their thoughts regarding projects, access important  information and receive immediate news regarding projects. Every Tuesday,  employees receive the &ldquo;Together toward the Target&rdquo; e-mail bulletin, which  provides information on changes and innovations which took place in the previous  week. Studies for an employee suggestions system, where employees will provide  suggestions, were initiated in the last quarter of 2013 and are expected to be  finalized and put in place in the first quarter of 2014. </p>
<p><strong>Principle 5: Robust Shareholders&rsquo;  Equity</strong></p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  works according to the qualitative majority principle, rather than one based on  absolute majority, in an aim to achieve sustainable profitability and growth.  Efforts towards this goal continued in 2013. </p>
<p>In order to  add more value to our country and to be a Bank which mainly finances the real  sector, the ratio of deposits that were converted into loans has also been  increased, as well as the share of loans by reducing the share of securities in  the balance sheet, which has paved the way for sound lending ratios. Efforts in  this direction will continue in 2014. </p>
<p>In order to  decrease liability side costs, non-deposit resources have been diversified. To  this end, syndication loans have been taken out and bank bonds and bills  issued. </p>
<p><strong>Principle 6: Integrated  Shareholding Management </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The shift  from a &ldquo;product customer&rdquo; approach to a &ldquo;Bank customer&rdquo; approach, which was  initiated in 2012 as a part of the &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo; project was  completed with the infrastructure put in place in 2012. In&nbsp;2013, Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s main goal was to shift its approach from &ldquo;Bank customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;Ziraat  customer&rdquo;, so that all the financial needs of its customers could be met under  the Ziraat Finance Group umbrella.</p>
<p>The  subsidiaries&rsquo; and international branches&rsquo; organizational evolution projects  have been ongoing since the second quarter of 2013. The&nbsp;process of  adaptation to the &ldquo;Ziraat Customer&rdquo; approach at the subsidiaries and branches  in 15 countries – the TRNC, Germany, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kazakhstan,  Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Russia, Iraq, Turkmenistan,  the USA, the UK and Saudi Arabia – which started in 2013, is expected to be  completed in 2014. Projects addressing the following issues were launched under  the Ziraat Customer Business Model for bank subsidiaries &amp; affiliates and  for its branches in fifteen countries in 2013:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organizational  structure revisions</li>
	<li>Customer/branch  segmentation</li>
	<li>Credit-rating  module design</li>
	<li>Revisions  in HR practices</li>
	<li>Core  banking software application upgrades</li>
	<li>Process  management</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is  planned to complete these projects in 2014, thereby also putting the finishing  touches on the global transformation of the Ziraat Finance Group.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Together toward the Target&rdquo; in the  150<sup>th</sup> year </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In 2013, Ziraat continued its journey of transformation, &ldquo;Together  toward the Target&rdquo; and put every effort in being &ldquo;More than a Bank&rdquo; in its 150<sup>th</sup>  year of operation.</p>
