<div id="midpanel">
	<p><strong>Activities in 2013</strong> <br />
Our Bank is  operating in a highly competitive sector, which includes international capital.  Our Bank carries forward its position of being the strongest national bank. Our  Bank maintained its civilized human resources policies in 2013, with the  awareness of its success, including its unique position in the sector,  pre-eminent market knowledge, ability to serve its customers at the right time,  through the right channel and with the right value propositions.</p>
	<p>In meeting  the requirements of the banking sector and international competition, our Bank  aims to provide a modern and credible service, and had 24,725 employees at the  end of 2013, 85% of which were university graduates, some with a master&rsquo;s  degree. While the average of age is 35, average employment year is 11. </p>
	<p>Our Bank  opened doors to new graduates aiming at a banking career in 2013, as in  previous years. The&nbsp;recruitment test and announcements asked the  candidates to specify their preferred city for working, in line with the  principle of hiring locally. In&nbsp;addition, our Bank started to hire  employees from among high school graduates and associate degree holders in its  150<sup>th</sup> anniversary year. </p>
	<p>In this  scope in 2013;</p>
	<p>41 Assistant  Inspectors, 37 Assistant Internal Auditors, 242 Assistant Specialists, 826  Service Clerks, 3,135 employees with the &ldquo;teller&rdquo; title and a total of 4,276 employees  began to work at our Bank.</p>
	<p>In addition,  in accordance with the needs of newly founded departments and the need for  experienced mid-level employees, 277 employees joined the Ziraat Bank family. </p>
	<p>Our Bank  aims to raise executive managers from its employees, in line with transparent  career management approach. Within this scope, a total of 6,375 employees were  promoted as a result of written and/or oral examinations in 2013. </p>
	<p>Major  innovations were also carried out in the human resources practices within the  scope of the Bank Customer Service Model concept formulated upon the principles  of &ldquo;customer-focus, rapid service delivery, and efficient communication.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>In line with  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s people-centric HR practices, employees perform their jobs according  to their competences and where they can enjoy job satisfaction. To sustain  this, the Bank switched from the title based vertical organizational structure  to a duty based horizontal organizational structure in 2012. In&nbsp;this  scope, the &ldquo;job position&rdquo; implementation was introduced in career management.  In&nbsp;addition to the title designation that indicates the professional level  of employees, a &ldquo;job position&rdquo; is determined for each employee in accordance  with the job performed, the customer segment addressed, and the distinction  between marketing versus operations functions. </p>
	<p>At the end  of 2013, a total of 1,634 branches had switched to the new business model and  24,725 employees had been appointed to their new job positions, according to  their talents and competence. As a result, the switch to the Bank Customer  Service Model was completed. </p>
	<p>In the scope  of 2013 training program, in order to help new recruits get to know the Bank,  adapt to the corporate culture and provide them with the necessary knowledge and  ability: &ldquo;First step to work&rdquo; training was provided; in order to provide  assistants and specialists with the necessary knowledge and ability,  &ldquo;Certification Training&rdquo; was provided; in order to support executives in  changing, transformation, being a part of the corporate strategy, for the right  use of motivation tools, problem solving: &ldquo;Management in Change Training&rdquo; was  provided; to inform employees of new products/ services/ regulatory provisions:  &ldquo;Vocational Training&rdquo; was provided. Additionally, there were some training  programs prepared in the scope of &ldquo;Statutory Obligation&rdquo;. </p>
	<p>During 2013,  training programs were provided to 21,278 employees and an average of 52 hours  in training time was provided per person.</p>
	<p>Besides, in  the scope of e-Training, e-training sessions were provided to 216,030 people in  2013. E-training has the advantages of low cost and time efficiency,  accessibility from every location (such as the workplace or at home), the  ability to be altered in line with employees&rsquo; learning curves and compatibility  with in-class training. </p>
	<p>In line with  the restructuring in title and duty positions, the Bank moved to the new  remuneration system based on titles and job positions of employees at the  beginning of the year. This system was revised and innovated according to needs  observed in 2013. A new practice was launched in the beginning of 2014: As per  this new practice, our Bank will pay – in addition to the regular wages and  salaries that are paid according to each employee&rsquo; title and position – a fee  to employees for remaining in their positions (or for maintaining their titles)  for a specific period of time. During the execution of this practice, the  minimum working periods (in a specific position or title) that are required for  promotion are also taken into account. </p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank Personal Performance  Bonus System</strong><br />
A new bonus  system was implemented in 2013 in accordance with the Bank&rsquo;s new organizational  structure and strategy which is focused marketing and sales, and aimed at  increasing the efficiency of sales employees, by using personal performances as  a basis. The&nbsp;Personal Bonus System was designed in line with the  increasing gain principle, which rewards increasing performance and efficiency,  providing higher compensation for those with a higher performance. Through  personal performance evaluations, bonus payments were made in accordance with  performance with the aim of strengthening the customer focused business model,  deepening the marketing and efficiency focused work approach by motivating employees,  increasing their corporate loyalty and rewarding personal success. </p>
<p>In the scope  of this implementation, considering our Bank&rsquo;s profitability and operational  results, bonus budget was determined not to extend 7% of total monthly wage  payments. These payments were determined according to substantial and  numerically measurable criteria, and paid to the employees pertaining to three  month periods beginning from February, May, August, and November. Bonus  payments were designed to provide additional payments to those who had achieved  a higher performance on a marketing basis and on the basis of: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Branch  segment and measure group,</li>
	<li>Ordering  according to performance ration cards, as a result of measurable performances  at the end of three months period,</li>
	<li>Performance  bonuses were distributed according to coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
	Different  coefficients are applied in the calculation of bonuses according to branch  segment, scale, and personal performance ordering and duty position. </p>
<p>As in other  banks, a performance bonus system was designed for rewarding higher performance  and increasing the efficiency of sales employees. In&nbsp;addition, employees  working in the operations departments of the branches and the general  directorate could be benefit from this implementation. </p>
<p><strong>2014 Projections</strong><strong> </strong><br />
	In 2014, our  Bank will continue to provide its employees with appropriate career  opportunities aligned with their respective job positions, and modern working  conditions.</p>
<p>In addition  to promotions regarding title, our Bank enriches career opportunities through  promotion. In&nbsp;this scope, implementation of the &ldquo;Competence Evaluation  System&rdquo; has been planned in order to evaluate our employees&rsquo; performance in  terms of their competence in their duties. </p>
<p>Furthermore,  establishing synergy between our Bank and domestic/international subsidiaries  and affiliates has been planned. In&nbsp;this scope, in order to improve  operational efficiency, updating of code of human resources, improving  personnel-duty matching, compensation and other benefits revision have been  planned to be completed during 2014. </p>
