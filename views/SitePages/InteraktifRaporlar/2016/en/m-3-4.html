<div class="baslik">INFORMATION ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES ACCORDING TO TYPE OF RISK</div>

<div class="sol">
	<p>Risk management activities at Ziraat  Bank are carried out with the underlying approach of aligning the Bank&rsquo;s risk  management functions with best practices by fostering a risk culture throughout  the entire Bank and constantly improving system and human resources.</p>
	<p>Risk management activities are conducted  under the separate headings of &ldquo;Credit Risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Market Risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Operational  Risk&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Balance Sheet Risks&rdquo;. Policies, practices, and procedures  concerning the management of these risks are governed by regulations and  resolutions approved by the Board of Directors for dealing with each category  of risk. All risk management system activities are carried out through the  involved participation of all the units with which each type of risk is  associated.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank has formulated an &ldquo;Intrinsic  capital adequacy assessment process&rdquo; as required by BDDK Regulation on banks&rsquo;  internal system and intrinsic capital adequacy assessment processes. The  purpose of this process is to set up and maintain a system that will both determine  the amounts of capital that are needed to cover the risks to which the Bank is  or might be exposed and will ensure capital requirements and levels are used  compatibly with the Bank&rsquo;s strategic objectives. Analyses are performed in line  with BDDK principles and are further supported by means of risk-specific stress  tests and scenario analyses. Year-end Stress Test and Internal Capital Adequacy  Assessment Process (ICAAP) reports are prepared with the involvement of other  appropriate units and are sent to BDDK with the approval of the Board of  Directors.</p>
	<p>The Bank&rsquo;s risk management activities  include the calculation of its leverage ratio as per Basel III criteria. The  results of this are reported both to BDDK and to TCMB.</p>
	<p>To determine the Bank&rsquo;s compliance with  Basel III liquidity criteria, Ziraat Bank prepares and sends to BDDK a  &ldquo;liquidity coverage ratio report&rdquo; as per that agency&rsquo;s Regulation on the  calculation of banks&rsquo; liquidity coverage ratio.</p>
	<p><strong>Credit Risk</strong><br />
	&ldquo;Credit risk&rdquo; is an expression of the  likelihood of the Bank&rsquo;s suffering a loss because a debtor fails to fulfill, in  a timely manner, some or all of his obligations under an agreement that he has  entered into. &ldquo;Credit risk management&rdquo; consists of discovering the credit risks  to which the Bank is exposed and defining, measuring, monitoring, controlling,  and reporting such risks.</p>
	<p>According to BDDK Regulation on  measurement and assessment of capital adequacy of banks, credit risk is to be  measured using the Basel III Standardized Approach and the results of such  measurements are to be included in one&rsquo;s mandatory reporting. In compliance  with this requirement, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s credit risk exposure on both a solo and a  consolidated basis is reported monthly to BDDK.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of credit risk management,  statistical methods are employed both to verify the credit rating models  developed by individual units and to quantify the effectiveness of their  performance. As required by the Banks Association of Turkey&rsquo;s Circular on  internal rating notifications, which went into effect as of January 2014,  Ziraat Bank sends its internal rating notices to the TBB Risk Center every  month. A Credit Risk Management with Advanced Methods Project has been launched  to permit the use of advanced methods in the calculation of the Bank&rsquo;s core  credit risk exposure.</p>
	<p>Both customer-segment-based credit risk  limits and trigger values and portfolio-based counterparty credit risk limits  and trigger values arising respectively from banking accounts and from trading  accounts have been calculated and approved by the Board of Directors. All these  values are monitored on a monthly basis. The risk-weighted assets which the  Bank may hold on a segment and portfolio basis are subject to these limits.</p>
	<p><strong>Market Risk</strong> <br />
		Market risk is an expression of the  possibility of loss that the Bank may be exposed to on account of its on- or  off-balance sheet exchange rate, commodity, interest rate and stock position  risk, which are subject to the Bank&rsquo;s trading activities and followed up under  the Bank&rsquo;s accounts and positions valued at fair value, and which arise from  the movements in market prices.</p>
	<p>Risk measurement and monitoring is  carried out in order to reveal the market risks to which Ziraat Bank may be  exposed. The results of these activities are taken into account in the Bank&rsquo;s  strategic decision-making processes.</p>
	<p>In order to manage market risk, market  movements that affect the present value of the portfolios which expose the Bank  to market risk in line with its trading strategies are kept track of on a daily  basis and the impact that both upward/downward and ordinary/extraordinary  movements may have on these portfolios is analyzed.</p>
	<p>In the conduct of its day-to-day  operations, trigger values are monitored as part of the early-warning process  that is carried out to protect the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength from being  seriously affected by increases in market volatility. Risk exposure levels are  kept within prescribed limits.</p>
	<p>The Standardized Approach methodology is  used to calculate the Bank&rsquo;s exposure to market risk, the amount of which is  included in its mandatory capital adequacy ratio. Market risk is also  calculated on a daily basis by an independent consultancy using a VaR-based  internal model that is recognized as being compatible with internationally-accepted  best practices. The effectiveness of the models being used is also analyzed by  means of backtesting.</p>
	<p><strong>Operational Risk</strong> <br />
	&ldquo;Operational risk&rdquo; is an expression of  the likelihood of the Bank&rsquo;s suffering a loss because of changes in value  caused by the fact that the actual losses which are incurred on account of  inadequate or failed internal processes, people, or systems or on account of  external events (including legal risk) differ from expected losses. The  operational risks that arise throughout the Bank are monitored through the  Ziraat Bank Operational Risk Loss Database. The mandatory capital needed to  cover the Bank&rsquo;s operational risk exposure is calculated using the Basic  Indicator Approach methodology and is allocated accordingly.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank employees perform their  duties taking into account the operational risk-related principles and  procedures set forth in the Bank&rsquo;s internal regulations and in a manner that is  both sensitive to the operational risks that may be incurred and mindful of  Bank policies intended to create an operational environment that will reduce  the likelihood of losses.</p>
	<p>Work is currently being carried out to  create a basic integrated risk framework for use at Ziraat Bank. IT-associated  risks and efforts to deal with them are monitored through the information  technology database.</p>
	<p>As part of the Business Continuity Plan,  &ldquo;business impact analyses&rdquo; are carried out in order both to identify the risks  that might arise if the Bank&rsquo;s operations are interrupted and to determine  their potential consequences.</p>
	<p>In order to ensure the continuity of  outsourced support services, the risks that might arise from their procurement  are assessed in light of BDDK Regulation on the outsourcing of support services  by banks.</p>
	<p><strong>Balance Sheet Risks</strong> <br />
	&ldquo;Balance sheet risks&rdquo;, which are risks  that arise from the Bank&rsquo;s on- and off-balance sheet asset and liability  accounts, are controlled so as to manage them in the most effective way  possible. Risk measurement and monitoring is carried out in order to reveal the  balance sheet risks to which Ziraat Bank may be exposed on account both of its  liquidity risks and of its interest rate risks arising from its banking  business accounts. The results of these activities are taken into account in  the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making processes.</p>
	<p>There are two components of liquidity  risk: funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk. The first is an  expression of the likelihood of the Bank&rsquo;s suffering a loss because it is  unable to satisfy all of its foreseeable/unforeseeable cash flow requirements  without otherwise impairing its day-to-day operations and/or financial  structure; the second is an expression of the likelihood of the Bank&rsquo;s  suffering a loss because the Bank is unable to close or cover a particular  position at the market price owing to insufficient market depth or to excessive  market volatility. Interest rate risk consists of the possibility of sustaining  losses on risk-sensitive assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items owing  to changes taking place in interest rates.</p>
	<p>Compliance with mandatory ratios  pertaining to liquidity and interest rate risks arising from banking business  accounts is also monitored. In addition to the foregoing, matters with the  potential to affect liquidity risk management are monitored funding and lending  maturity mismatches, assets&rsquo; and liabilities&rsquo; behavioral as well as contractual  maturities, the level of primary (cash and cash-equivalent) liquidity reserves  needed to conduct the Bank&rsquo;s normal day-to-day operations, Central Bank  liquidity facilities to which recourse may be had in order to cope with  unexpected liquidity requirements, secondary reserves whose potential to be  converted to cash is exposed to the risk of their being under priced, and the  ability to borrow from conventional markets are monitored. Additionally, within  the content of scenario and sensitivity analyses 
		stress test is conducted to assess the  Bank&rsquo;s liquidity needs in the worst case scenario and the loss that may result  therefrom.</p>
	<p>For the management of the interest rate  risk arising on banking business accounts, attention is given to monitoring and  analyzing such issues as rate and maturity mismatches between fixed- and  variable-interest fundings and lendings, assets&rsquo; and liabilities&rsquo; behavioral as  well as contractual maturities, both upward/downward and ordinary/extraordinary  movements in interest rates, and the impact of interest rate margins on the  current value of assets and liabilities. A close watch is also kept on any  positions involving Turkish lira vs foreign currency interest rate margins.</p>
	<p>In the conduct of its day-to-day  operations, trigger values are monitored as part of the early-warning process  that is carried out to protect the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength from being  seriously affected by increases in market volatility and/or by  incoming/outgoing cash flow mismatches. Associated risk exposure levels are  defined within limits in light of such considerations as liquidity, income  level targets, and appetite for risk and come into force upon the approval of  the Board of Directors. There have been no overruns in the Bank&rsquo;s internal  limits, which are regularly monitored.</p>
