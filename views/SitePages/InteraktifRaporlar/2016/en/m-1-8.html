	<h1>The year 2016 was marked by the political developments in  the US and Europe, as well as the economic recovery in developed countries  after the global crisis.</h1>
	<h2><strong>Fed,  ECB</strong>FED AND ECB MAINTAINED A SUPPORTIVE STANCE  AGAINST THE LIKELY FRAGILITY IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS.</h2>
	<p><strong>Outlook for the world economy</strong><br />
		The year 2016 was marked by the  political developments in the US and Europe, as well as the economic recovery  in developed countries after the global crisis. The raft of strong data  releases from the US and European economies continued throughout the year. The  Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained a  supportive stance against the likely fragility in the recovery process. The ECB  extended its quantitative easing program until the end of 2017, while the Fed  raised interest rates only once during the year. However, it was political  developments that took precedence over economic developments in both  continents. The presidential elections in the United States and the UK&rsquo;s exit  process from the European Union (Brexit), along with the referendum in Italy  all increased volatility in the markets. The rally in commodity prices,  especially oil, supported the industrial sector by raising producer prices and  ensuring that commodity exporters also positively decoupled.</p>
	<p>The US economy continued to post  moderate growth during the year, with further growth in employment without  apparent inflationary pressures. Backed by the robust position of the US  economy, the Fed endorsed a quarter point increase in interest rates, in spite  of the increase in uncertainty that followed the presidential election in  November, with 2016 rounded off with one interest rate hike, as in 2015. After  the election of the new president in the US, there was a sense that uncertainty  over the country&rsquo;s politics would remain, especially when it comes to foreign  trade and finance and this increased volatility in the global markets. Mounting  expectations that expansive fiscal policies would be implemented in the  economy, stimulating growth, boosted the view that the Fed would tighten its  monetary policy more rapidly than what had been foreseen, precipitating a  significant uptrend in inflation expectations and bond yields, with the USD  gaining against other currencies. The jump in yields on US 10-year bonds,  widely referred to as risk-free interest rates, ushered in a wave of selling in  global bond markets and sparked capital outflows from developing countries along  with significant increases in bond yields in these countries. Against such a  backdrop, the increase in global interest rates could lead to a tightening of  financial conditions in a number of countries. Protectionist foreign trade  policies have raised question marks over the future of international trade  agreements. There could be pressure on growth rates and employment in North  America and in Asia, which are part of the US value chain, if protectionist  policies are placed on foreign trade. Therefore, the normalization of the Fed&rsquo;s  policy will depend on an expanding fiscal policy in the US and foreign trade  policies in 2017.</p>
	<p>Political developments in the Eurozone  left their mark on 2016, which saw heightened concerns over the region&rsquo;s  banking sector with a spate of reports concerning Eurozone-based banks, mainly  Italian banks and Deutsche Bank. With some negative interest rates in the  region, interest income has come under pressure, leading to low profitability  for banks. Low profitability and the ratio of problematic loans remain sources  of concern for the banking sector in the region. Although the immediate fallout  in global markets to the UK&rsquo;s referendum vote to leave the European Union was  short-lived, the markets will be keeping a very careful watch on how the  relationship between countries pans out in the medium term, given the  commercial and financial importance of relations between the UK and the  European Union. Following the Brexit decision, the Bank of England (BoE), which  has been following an accommodative policy towards the economy, lowered its  policy rate to its lowest level since 2009. The fall in the pound, due to  uncertainty and rising oil prices, has set UK inflation on a course to exceed  the 2% target in the medium term. Despite inflationary pressures, the BoE is  expected to maintain its accommodative monetary policy aimed at supporting the  economy in anticipation of the volatility that is expected during the process.  With two important elections scheduled in 2017 in Germany and France, the two  biggest economies of the Eurozone, the ECB extended its asset purchase program  in the December meeting, with the program set to continue until the end of 2017  with the aim of protecting the markets and economic activity against any  potential uncertainty resulting from the elections. The ECB also signaled that  it would normalize its monetary policy over a reasonable time scale by reducing  the monthly purchasing amount from EUR&nbsp;80 billion to EUR&nbsp;60 billion.  Within rising inflation with the impact of energy prices and recovery in  production-driven economic activity, the ECB is expected to maintain its asset  purchase program in its current form for some time in this election year.  European voters are expected to vote to prevent populist parties from coming to  power in the elections, although these parties may well see some increase in  their support as voters express their reactions to the governing parties.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile China underwent the painful  transition period from export and investment-based growth to a consumption-based  growth model. The extent of volatilities arising from Chinese data releases  eased considerably in 2016 with markets adjusting to China&rsquo;s new normal, which  can be summed up as a lower rate of growth. The recovery in commodity prices  kept China&rsquo;s Producer Price Index (PPI) data in positive territory after a long  break, marking the end of the deflationary spread between China and the rest of  the world. The increase in profit margins is expected to support the  manufacturing industry In addition, commodity prices, especially oil, have  risen significantly, following China&rsquo;s supply limitations that has demonstrated  balanced and stable growth, as well as OPEC and non-OPEC members. Commodity  exporters such as Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia decoupled positively among  emerging economies on the back of the rise in commodity prices during 2016. A  continuation of the trend in commodity prices would help limit the  deterioration in the budget balances of commodity exporters while contributing  positively to global economic activity by supporting their growth. On the other  hand, the increased protectionism in foreign trade in 2017 is causing a concern  in global markets, especially in China and Mexico.</p>
	<h1>CBRT continued its monetary policy simplification steps,  which began in March 2016, with moderate and cautious steps until September due  to the decline in inflationary pressures.</h1>
	<p><strong>Outlook for the Turkish economy</strong><br />
		The Turkish economy was buffeted by  domestic and geopolitical developments, as well as turbulence in global markets  during 2016. The expectation that a more stringent monetary policy would be  pursued in the US after the presidential election precipitated a wave of  portfolio outflows from developing countries, including Turkey. Compounded by  the decisions taken by credit rating agencies, TL negatively decoupled from  peer currencies. However, the CBRT sought to balance the risks in the short run  with the liquidity steps it implemented. A combination of macro-prudential and  structural policies along with strong fiscal discipline is expected to return  the economy to an even keel in the medium term.</p>
	<p>Despite the extraordinary developments  and shocks experienced during the year, the Turkish economy managed to post a  modest degree of growth in 2016. The economy, which is estimated to have posted  some degree of a recovery in the last quarter, is expected to maintain a  moderate recovery in 2017 with the support of incentives and measures. A manageable  increase in credit growth, supported by a revival of consumer credits and  commercial credits in TL terms, is expected to support domestic demand with the  uncertainties left behind and the economy will return to a stable growth  course.</p>
	<p>Despite the rise in commodity prices and  contraction in the tourism sector in 2016, the current account balance remained  similar to its 2015 level, with the positive trend of foreign trade limits.  While it is thought that the recent depreciation of the TL would have had a  positive reflection on exports, our exporters did not lose their ability to  diversify markets, providing us with a greater degree of flexibility when  compared to similar countries. Exports are expected to be buoyed by the  continued growth in demand from the European Union countries and normalizing  relations with neighboring countries. The tourism sector is expected to benefit  from the possibility of improved relations with Russia, although geopolitical  developments will have an important bearing on trends in tourism.</p>
	<h2><strong>8%</strong>CBRT EXPECTS INFLATION OF AROUND 8% IN 2017. </h2>
	<p>At the end of 2016, consumer inflation  exceeded the CBRT&rsquo;s 7.5% inflation forecast, mainly due to the cumulative  effect of exchange rate movements and tax adjustments. The weaker TL and higher  commodity prices created upward pressure on inflation. Based on current  projections, the CBRT has revised its inflation forecast upwards from 6.5% and  expects inflation of around 8% in 2017. Movements in the foreign exchange  market, food prices and developments in demand conditions are the main determinants  of the course of inflation this year.</p>
	<p>CBRT continued its monetary policy  simplification steps, which began in March 2016, with moderate and cautious  steps until September due to the decline in inflationary pressures. In the  framework of simplification steps, CBRT had lowered upper boundary of the  corridor by a total of 250 basis points by September, leaving the corridor at  its narrowest ever level. CBRT then interrupted the simplification process,  taking the view that the excessive exchange rate volatility amid mounting  uncertainty following the US presidential elections would cause upward risks on  inflation and turned its attention to policies intended to support the TL by  implementing monetary tightening. As well as increasing the cost of borrowing  for the TL to a limited extent, it also aims to support the TL with a dynamic  reaction through various applications within the foreign exchange liquidity  management.</p>
