	<p><strong>2015 Activities</strong></p>
	<p>In an intensively competitive sector in which there is a significant  international capital presence, Ziraat Bank advances its stature as the biggest  and strongest nationally-owned bank year after year. Recognizing that it owes  its unique and distinguished position in the sector to superior human resources  whose unrivalled market knowledge and experience enable them to supply  customers with the right value, at the right time, and through the right  channel, Ziraat Bank continues to implement the progressive human resources management  system that it has adopted.</p>
	<p>Seeking to deliver innovative and trustworthy products and services that  satisfy the requirements of both the banking industry and of international  competition, Ziraat Bank had a total of 25,697 people on its payroll as of  end-2015. As of the same date the average age and length of service of the  Bank&rsquo;s workforce were 34.5 years and 10.5 years respectively while 86% of the  Bank&rsquo;s employees held associate, undergraduate, graduate, and/or doctoral  university degrees.</p>
	<p>As in previous years, in 2015 Ziraat Bank once again continued to seek  out and recruit young people wishing to pursue a career in banking.</p>
	<p>Interviews with those who successfully passed the written exams that  were conducted in collaboration with Anadolu University on  11&nbsp;October&nbsp;2014 to fulfill the Bank&rsquo;s 2015 manpower requirements were  completed last year and a total of 2,008 people were taken on, 973 as tellers  and 1,035 as service desk officers.</p>
	<p>As a result of written and oral exams conducted in 2015, 144 personnel  consisting of 32 assistant inspectors, 93 assistant specialists, and 19  attorneys were also hired last year. Another 85 people joined the Ziraat Bank  family in various positions in line <br />
		both with the Bank&rsquo;s needs and with the requirements of laws and  regulations.</p>
	<p>As a result of new branch openings, mutual agreements, voluntary  retirements, and the like, there has been a substantial decline in the number  of personnel employed in &ldquo;Permanent Security Guard&rdquo; positions at the Bank in  recent years. As a result of the shortage in Permanent Security Guard personnel  which caused by the transfer of a significant number of people in this job  category to Banking Staff positions in 2014, a total of 1,249 people who had  previously been employed as guards at the Bank for at least five years and who  had been provided by private security companies, were enrolled under Private  Security Guard title at the Bank as of 31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015.</p>
	<p>In keeping with the transparent career management approach to which it  adheres, Ziraat Bank seeks to train its own managers itself as much as  possible. 3,196 existing employees who successfully took the written and oral  promotion exams that were conducted in 2015 were promoted to a higher job  category. The&nbsp;average pass rate on these exams was 63%.</p>
	<p>As a huge family of more than 25,000 members, Ziraat Bank gives great  importance to its employees&rsquo; job satisfaction and it provides its personnel  with career-path opportunities that allow them to advance themselves in  different aspects of banking. For example to meet its requirements for internal  controllers, interviews were conducted among banking staff on  15-16&nbsp;April&nbsp;2015 and eleven people were transferred from their  existing positions to new ones.</p>
	<p>A management trainee program was conducted for personnel who have  reached the Authorized level in order to ready them for branch and headquarters  management-level positions and duties. About 350 existing personnel were  appointed to branch or <br />
		unit management positions shortly after successfully completing this  program.</p>
	<p>The Finart Transfer Request program is conducted twice a year to  increase Bank personnel motivation, minimize operational workloads, and ensure  that transfer processes are carried out quickly, effectively, and methodically.  Applications to take part in this program are accepted in December-January and  in June-July. Last year 1,223 transfer requests were submitted in the first  round and 1,096 were submitted in the second. Of these, 742 and 708 transfers  were approved respectively.</p>
	<p>The highlights of the new payroll management system governing salary and  other payment practices that was introduced in 2015 are summarized below.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The salaries of employees covered by the collective  bargaining agreement signed on 31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2014 were adjusted as  mandated by that contract.</li>
		<li>Payments that previously used to be made by hand for  such things as return from leave without pay and out-of-pocket expenses and for  performance bonuses are now being calculated by the system and added to the  appropriate monthly payroll.</li>
		<li>Unearned salary and bonus payments that were made to  terminated personnel or to personnel on leave without pay are now being  recovered through the Finart system.</li>
		<li>As part of the overall process of systematizing  personnel-related payments and collections, interim payments are being made  through the bank&rsquo;s internal system while unearned amounts are being recovered  through the Finart system.</li>
		<li>As a result of a project undertaken jointly by the  Subsidiaries &amp; IT Management Group and the International Branch Banking  Department, a career progression and remuneration system has been set up for  the bank&rsquo;s international operations.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Support was also provided for the preparation of human resources  regulations and the formulation of remuneration systems for three members of  the Ziraat Finance Group (Ziraat Insurance, Ziraat Life &amp; Pension, Ziraat  Technology) and for the conduct of Ziraat Technology&rsquo;s 2015 recruitment exams.</p>
	<p>Human resources consultancy and support services were provided during  the establishment of Ziraat Katılım  credit union, a Ziraat Bank subsidiary that was  incorporated on 10&nbsp;October&nbsp;2014. Support was also provided prior to  the conduct of the recruitment exams which that bank held on  27&nbsp;February&nbsp;2016 to fulfill its staffing requirements.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank Individual  Performance Bonus System</strong></p>
	<p>Created in 2013 to be compatible with the bank&rsquo;s new marketing and  sales-focused organizational structure and strategy and informed by the  principle that earnings should match success, the Ziraat Bank Individual  Performance Bonus System was designed so as to reward employees who demonstrate  superior performance and productivity by paying them more. Determined and paid  on the basis of periodically conducted individual performance reviews,  individual performance bonuses are intended to strengthen the bank&rsquo;s  customer-focused business model, to promote a marketing and  effectiveness-focused approach to work, to increase company loyalty by motiving  personnel, and to provide tangible benefits to those whose individual  achievements are compatible with the bank&rsquo;s corporate objectives.</p>
	<p>Beginning in 2014, a current bonus budget was allocated taking the  Bank&rsquo;s profitability and operational results into account with the proviso that  the budget&rsquo;s total amount not exceeds 8% of the Bank&rsquo;s aggregate monthly salary  payments. The&nbsp;same procedure was followed in 2015. This allocation is paid  out to recipients as an individual performance bonus at three-month intervals  along with their February, May, August, and November salaries based on  objectively defined and numerically expressible specific criteria. In this  system, which has been set up to focus mainly on marketing in line with the  Bank&rsquo;s strategies and targets, bonuses are paid so as to enhance the earnings  of those who contribute more to the realization of those strategies and  targets.</p>
	<p>Branch segment and scale group rankings that have been determined  according to individual performance report cards in line with the numerical  performance measurement results at three-month intervals are notified to  employees based on their performance bonus coefficients.</p>
	<p>The different coefficients that are used when calculating bonuses are  determined jointly by business units according to branch segment and scale,  individual performance ranking, and job position criteria. Marketing group  personnel bonuses are calculated in direct proportion to the numerical  performance points in each section. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2014,  the bonuses of counter personnel started being calculated based on the  performance of the counter to which they were assigned. The&nbsp;same procedure  was also followed in 2015.</p>
	<p>As is the case with other banks in Turkey, the Ziraat Bank Individual  Performance Bonus System has been designed to reward superior performance and  essentially to increase the productivity of sales personnel. However individual  performance bonuses are also paid to operational personnel in branches and to  headquarters employees in line with stipulated criteria.</p>
	<p>In the period ahead the Bank plans to start differentiating not only the  individual performance bonus payments that are currently being made to  personnel in headquarters units whose numerical performance is being measured  but also in line with the results of the numerical performance system that is  being set up for headquarters sales units.</p>
	<p><strong>Human resources in 2016</strong></p>
	<p>In 2016 Ziraat Bank will continue to provide its employees with  position-compatible career-path opportunities and with progressive working  conditions.</p>
	<p>722 of the prospective teller and service desk officer candidates who  were shortlisted on the basis of the interviews conducted among 2,000 people  who sat for the 11&nbsp;October&nbsp;2014 written exams will be hired in 2016.</p>
	<p>Promotion exams will be held for existing employees in the second half  of the year as prescribed by the Bank&rsquo;s human resources principles, procedures,  and practices.</p>
	<p>The results of the Competency Evaluation System will be integrated into  the Career Management System.</p>
	<p>Authorized-level personnel who are successful in the management trainee  programs conducted in 2016 will continue to be appointed to branch/unit manager  positions as needs dictate.</p>
	<p>Continuing to provide its employees with new career-path opportunities,  Ziraat Bank will conduct an exam for those wishing to transfer to an internal  controller position.</p>
	<p>A project is currently being conducted to allow requests and opinions  concerning changes in employees&rsquo; job assignments and locations to be submitted  online. For the time being, personnel transfer requests will continue to be  accepted in June-July and in December-January.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of the transformation projects being undertaken to  increase both synergies among Ziraat Finance Group members and the operational  effectiveness of the Bank&rsquo;s international units, the work of matching the staff  and job-positions of all of our international units and of revising  remuneration systems and other entitlements was largely completed in 2015. Work  will continue on updating HR regulations accordingly in 2016.</p>
