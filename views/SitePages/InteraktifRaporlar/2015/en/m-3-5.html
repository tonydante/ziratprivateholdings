<div class="baslik">Information about Risk Management Policies and Activities According to Type of Risk</div>

<div class="sol">
	<p>Risk management activities at Ziraat Bank are carried out with  the underlying approach of aligning the Bank&rsquo;s risk management functions with  best practices by fostering a risk culture throughout the entire Bank and  constantly improving system and human resources.</p>
	<p>Risk management activities are conducted under the separate  headings of &ldquo;Credit Risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Market Risk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Operational Risk&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Balance  Sheet Risks&rdquo;. Policies, practices, and procedures concerning the management of  these risks are governed by regulations approved by the Board of Directors for  dealing with each category of risk. Care is given to ensure that all risk  management system activities are coordinated through the involved participation  of the operational branches with which each type of risk is associated.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank has formulated an &ldquo;Intrinsic capital adequacy  assessment process&rdquo; as required by BDDK Regulation on banks&rsquo; internal system  and intrinsic capital adequacy assessment processes. The purpose of this  process is to set up and maintain a system that will both determine the amounts  of capital that are needed to cover the risks to which the Bank is or might be  exposed and will ensure capital requirements and levels are used compatibly  with the Bank&rsquo;s strategic objectives. Analyses are performed in line with BDDK  principles and are further supported by means of risk-specific stress tests and  scenario analyses. Year-end Stress Test and Internal Capital Adequacy  Assessment Process (ICAAP) reports are prepared with the involvement of other  appropriate units and are sent to BDDK with the approval of the Board of  Directors.</p>
	<p>The Bank&rsquo;s risk management activities include the calculation of  its leverage ratio as per Basel III criteria. The results of this are reported  both to BDDK and to TCMB.</p>
	<p>To determine the Bank&rsquo;s compliance with Basel III liquidity  criteria, Ziraat Bank has begun preparing and sending to BDDK a &ldquo;liquidity  coverage ratio report&rdquo; as per that agency&rsquo;s Regulation on the calculation of  banks&rsquo; liquidity coverage ratio.</p>
	<p><strong>Credit Risk</strong></p>
	<p>&ldquo;Credit risk&rdquo; is an expression of the likelihood of the bank&rsquo;s  suffering a loss because a debtor fails to fulfill, in a timely manner, some or  all of his obligations under an agreement that he has entered into.</p>
	<p>&ldquo;Credit risk management&rdquo; consists of discovering the credit  risks to which the bank is exposed and defining, measuring, monitoring,  controlling, and reporting such risks.</p>
	<p>According to BDDK Regulation on measurement and assessment of  capital adequacy of banks, credit risk is to be measured using the Basel III  Standardized Approach and the results of such measurements are to be included  in one&rsquo;s mandatory reporting. In compliance with this requirement, Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s credit risk exposure on both a solo and a consolidated basis is reported  monthly to BDDK.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of credit risk management, statistical methods  are employed both to verify the credit rating models developed by individual  units and to quantify the effectiveness of their performance. As required by  the Banks Association of Turkey&rsquo;s Circular on internal rating notifications,  which went into effect as of January 2014, Ziraat Bank sends its internal  rating notices to the TBB Risk Center every month. A number of projects are  also being planned to permit the use of advanced methods in the calculation of  the Bank&rsquo;s core credit risk exposure.</p>
	<p>Both customer-segment-based credit risk limits and trigger  values and portfolio-based counterparty credit risk limits and trigger values  arising respectively from banking accounts and from trading accounts have been  calculated and approved by the Board of Directors. All these values are  monitored on a monthly basis. The risk-weighted assets which the Bank may hold  on a segment and portfolio basis are subject to these limits.</p>
	<p><strong>Market Risk</strong></p>
	<p>&ldquo;Market risk&rdquo; is an expression of the likelihood of the bank&rsquo;s  suffering a loss because of movements in the market prices of assets in which  the bank takes positions and/or trades and which are accounted for at their  fair (mark-to-market) value. Such assets include, but are not limited to,  financial instruments and their derivatives and precious metals, commodities,  and foreign currencies which may be held in on- or off-balance sheet accounts.  The term &ldquo;market risk&rdquo; embraces many different aspects of risk such as general  market risk, specific risk, exchange rate risk, commodity risk, clearance risk,  trading account counterparty risk, and option risk.</p>
	<p>Risk measurement and monitoring is carried out in order to  reveal the market risks to which Ziraat Bank may be exposed. The results of  these activities are taken into account in the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making  processes.</p>
	<p>In order to manage market risk, market movements that affect the  present value of the portfolios which expose the Bank to market risk in line  with its trading strategies are kept track of on a daily basis and the impact  that both upward/downward and ordinary/extraordinary movements may have on  these portfolios is analyzed.</p>
	<p>In the conduct of its day-to-day operations, trigger values are  monitored as part of the early-warning process that is carried out to protect  the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength from being seriously affected by increases in  market volatility. Risk exposure levels are kept within prescribed limits.</p>
	<p>The Standardized Approach methodology is used to calculate the  Bank&rsquo;s exposure to market risk, the amount of which is included in its  mandatory capital adequacy ratio. Market risk is also calculated on a daily  basis by an independent consultancy using a VaR-based internal model that is  recognized as being compatible with internationally-accepted best practices.  The effectiveness of the models being used is also analyzed by means of  backtesting.</p>
	<p><strong>Operational Risk</strong></p>
	<p>&ldquo;Operational risk&rdquo; is an expression of the likelihood of the  bank&rsquo;s suffering a loss because of changes in value caused by the fact that the  actual losses which are incurred on account of inadequate or failed internal  processes, people, or systems or on account of external events (including legal  risk) differ from expected losses. Ziraat Bank employees perform their duties  taking into account the operational risk-related principles and procedures set forth  in the Bank&rsquo;s internal regulations and in a manner that is both sensitive to  the operational risks that may be incurred and mindful of Bank policies  intended to create an operational environment that will reduce the likelihood  of losses.</p>
	<p>The operational risks that arise throughout the Bank are  monitored through the Ziraat Bank Operational Risk Loss Database. The mandatory  capital needed to cover the Bank&rsquo;s operational risk exposure is calculated  using the Basic Indicator Approach methodology and is allocated accordingly.</p>
	<p>Work is currently being carried out to create a basic integrated  risk framework for use at Ziraat Bank. IT-associated risks and efforts to deal  with them are monitored through the information technology database.</p>
	<p>As part of the Business Continuity Plan, &ldquo;business impact  analyses&rdquo; are carried out in order both to identify the risks that might arise  if the Bank&rsquo;s operations are interrupted and to determine their potential  consequences.</p>
	<p>In order to ensure the continuity of outsourced support  services, the risks that might arise from their procurement are assessed in  light of BDDK Regulation on the outsourcing of support services by banks.</p>
	<p><strong>Balance Sheet Risks</strong></p>
	<p>&ldquo;Balance sheet risks&rdquo;, which are risks that arise from the  bank&rsquo;s on- and off-balance sheet asset and liability accounts, are controlled  so as to manage them in the most effective way possible. Balance sheet risks  include the liquidity risks and the interest rate risks to which the bank is  exposed on account of its banking business accounts. There are two components  of liquidity risk: funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk. The first  is an expression of the likelihood of the bank&rsquo;s suffering a loss because it is  unable to satisfy all of its foreseeable/unforeseeable cash flow requirements  without otherwise impairing its day-to-day operations and/or financial  structure; the second is an expression of the likelihood of the bank&rsquo;s  suffering a loss because the bank is unable to close or cover a particular  position at the market price owing to insufficient market depth or to excessive  market volatility. Interest rate risk consists of the possibility of sustaining  losses on risk-sensitive assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items owing  to changes taking place in interest rates.</p>
	<p>Risk measurement and monitoring is carried out in order to  reveal the balance sheet risks to which Ziraat Bank may be exposed on account  both of its liquidity risks and of its interest rate risks arising from its  banking business accounts. The results of these activities are taken into  account in the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making processes.</p>
	<p>Compliance with mandatory ratios pertaining to liquidity and  interest rate risks arising from banking business accounts is also monitored.  In addition to the foregoing, matters with the potential to affect liquidity  risk management are monitored and scenario and sensitivity analyses are  performed. These include funding and lending maturity mismatches, assets&rsquo; and  liabilities&rsquo; behavioral as well as contractual maturities, the level of primary  (cash and cash-equivalent) liquidity reserves needed to conduct the bank&rsquo;s  normal day-to-day operations, Central Bank liquidity facilities to which  recourse may be had in order to cope with unexpected liquidity requirements,  secondary reserves whose potential to be converted to cash is exposed to the  risk of their being underpriced, and the ability to borrow from conventional  markets.</p>
	<p>For the management of the interest rate risk arising on banking  business accounts, attention is given to monitoring and analyzing such issues  as rate and maturity mismatches between fixed- and variable-interest fundings  and lendings, assets&rsquo; and liabilities&rsquo; behavioral as well as contractual  maturities, both upward/downward and ordinary/extraordinary movements in  interest rates, and the impact of interest rate margins on the current value of  assets and liabilities. A close watch is also kept on any positions involving  Turkish lira vs foreign currency interest rate margins.</p>
	<p>In the conduct of its day-to-day operations, trigger values are  monitored as part of the early-warning process that is carried out to protect  the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength from being seriously affected by increases in  market volatility and/or by incoming/outgoing cashflow mismatches. Associated  risk exposure levels are kept within limits as prescribed by the Board of  Directors in light of such considerations as liquidity, income level targets,  and appetite for risk. </p>
