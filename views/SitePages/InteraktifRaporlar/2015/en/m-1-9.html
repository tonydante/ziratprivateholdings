	<h1>In 2015 Ziraat Bank booked a profit of TL 5.2 billion, which was 27.5% higher than that of the previous year, while it also performed well as measured by numerous profitability and productivity indicators.</h1>

<div class="saga">
<h4>high value added products and services</h4>
<h4>112</h4>
<p>112 new branches are opened in 2015.</p>
</div>

	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank continued to fulfill  the commitments laid out in the 2015 roadmap and achieved many successful  results.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>In line with the seven key  objectives that it has identified, Ziraat Bank supplied an increasingly greater  stream of high value added products, services, and solutions to customers in  every segment in all three of its basic business lines of Corporate Banking,  Mass Banking, and International Banking.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>While doing so, Ziraat Bank also  focused on generating as much value added as possible in line with the Integrated  Partnership Management approach to which it adheres in its dealings with the  domestic and international subsidiaries and affiliates that make up the Ziraat  Finance Group. </strong></p>
	<p>Pursuing growth consistent with its customer-focused  balance-sheet structure, its robust equity mix, and its sustainable  profitability objective, in 2015 Ziraat Bank booked a profit of TL&nbsp;5.2  billion, which was 27.5% higher than that of the previous year, while it also  performed well as measured by numerous profitability and productivity  indicators.</p>
	<p>While maintaining its broadly-based deposit structure, the Bank  nonetheless abstained from the destructive competition in the market for  deposits whose consequences are so injurious to the sector as a whole. Efforts  were also made to diversify Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s non-deposit sources of funding.</p>
	<p>At more than 400 locations all over Turkey, Ziraat Bank remains the only  supplier of financial solutions to which its customers may have recourse.  The&nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s already extensive domestic branch network reach was further  expanded with the addition of 112 new branches in 2015.</p>
	<p>In the &ldquo;Bonds &amp; Loans Turkey 2015&rdquo; event organized by Global  Financial Conferences, one of the world&rsquo;s leading organizers of prestigious  international financing and investment gatherings, Ziraat Bank won awards in  seven different categories including first-places for four of the projects for  which its supplied financing and which made it to the final: the Gebze-İzmir  Motorway, Dalaman Airport, the Kayseri Health Campus, and the Yeniköy Kemerköy  Thermal Power Plant.</p>
<h2>Corporate/Entrepreneurial Banking</h2>
	<p><strong>Towards Turkey&rsquo;s 2023  Vision…</strong><br />
One of the goals set out in Turkey&rsquo;s 2023 Vision is  that the country will join the ranks of the world&rsquo;s ten biggest economies by  that year.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank is playing an increasingly greater role in  Turkey&rsquo;s long-term growth and development processes by supplying funding  resources, products, and services that are compatible with that goal while also  contributing to job-creation and to economic growth in the broadest sense.</p>
	<p>Mindful of its own vision of being both its sector&rsquo;s  leader and an ethical and global bank, Ziraat Bank therefore continues to play  a leading role in the financing of high value added, feasible, and medium- and  large-scale projects that will especially contribute to the national economy  and reduce its external dependency.</p>
	<p><strong>Goal: Work with all  sectors and all economic actors</strong><br />
		A fundamental Ziraat Bank objective is to work with  all economic actors irrespective of their sector.</p>
	<p>In addition to its core business activities of  financing agricultural production, agroindustry, and industrial endeavors,  trade finance has also emerged recently as one of the business lines in which  Ziraat Bank is increasing its presence and competitive strength.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank has 22  corporate branches.</strong><br />
		Twenty-two of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s branches have been  designated &ldquo;corporate branches&rdquo; and given the mission of managing existing  corporate customers&rsquo; portfolios in the most productive way possible while also  increasing the number of such customers with which they actively work. By  virtue both of the business volumes they generate and of the range of firms  they deal with, corporate branches continued to play an effective and leading  role in diversifying 
		Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and customer base in 2015.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s real-sector  financing grew faster than the sectoral average. </strong><br />
		The support that Ziraat Bank provides to real-sector  endeavors grew faster than the overall sectoral average in 2015. Cash loan  disbursements to corporate-segment customers increased by 44% year-on and  reached TL&nbsp;68 billion in value while non-cash credit was also up by 45%  and amounted to TL&nbsp;53 billion.</p>
	<p>In 2015 Ziraat Bank also made important progress  towards achieving its goal of deepening relationships with customers and  becoming their primary and actively-serving bank.</p>
	<p>The Bank&rsquo;s essential focus is that a Ziraat customer  should be working with every member of the Ziraat Finance Group insofar as is  possible. To the degree that groupwise synergistic collaboration increases so  too will it be possible to more effectively satisfy the real sector&rsquo;s needs for  financing its domestic and international business endeavors. That in turn will  further strengthen Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s position as the Turkish banking industry&rsquo;s  front-runner and leader. </p>
	<p><strong>The right value at the  right time through the right channel</strong><br />
		The ongoing &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Going Together, Further Ahead&rdquo;  transformation program that Ziraat Bank originally launched with the &ldquo;Together,  to a Better Future&rdquo; slogan is aimed at correctly identifying customers&rsquo;  financial needs and then supplying them with the right value, at the right  time, and through the right channel.</p>
	<p>In this context and within the framework of Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Customer-Focused Banking&rdquo; approach, a large number of projects have  been initiated at the Bank&rsquo;s headquarters, regional, and branch units since the  introduction of the Ziraat Bank Customer Service Model.</p>
	<p>In 2015 the Bank commissioned its flexible payment  plan infrastructure in order to ensure that its corporate banking products and  services are sectorally competitive and address customers&rsquo; needs.  Infrastructure has also been installed for the pricing of the fees and  commissions charged on foreign trade finance and these are now being  systematically monitored.</p>
	<p>Preliminary work has been completed on infrastructure  that will allow the systematic processing of the Hermes, SEP, CERV, and GSM  credits that are obtained from abroad to finance imports into the country. This  system scheduled to go into operation by midyear 2016.</p>
	<p>System- and legal-framework infrastructures related to  free-zone branch business processes have been installed and were ready to go  into service at the beginning of 2016.</p>
	<p>Ongoing projects and personnel training aimed at  streamlining process, system, and regulatory processes so as to deliver  better-quality service within the framework of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Customer-Focused  Banking&rdquo; approach will continue in 2016 as well.</p>
	<p><strong>2015 highlights in the  Corporate &amp; Entrepreneurial Banking segments</strong></p>
	<p><strong>EUR&nbsp;100 million from  the French Development Agency</strong><br />
		A twelve-year, EUR&nbsp;100 million line of credit was  obtained from the French Development Agency to provide attractively-priced  financing to agricultural-sector SMEs that process animal-source foods. Ziraat  Bank began lending this to its customers at attractive rates in 2015.</p>
	<p>This line of credit is to be used as loans to SMEs  engaged in the non-primary (in other words other than animal husbandry) aspects  of animal-source food production in order to finance modernization projects  that will bring them into compliance with EU hygiene and environment standards  and with the requirements of Turkish laws and regulations governing veterinary  services, plant health, food, and animal feed.</p>

<div class="saga">
<h4>working capital for SMEs</h4>
<h4>USD 200 million</h4>
<p>World Bank credit to finance SMEs</p>
</div>

	<p><strong>Council of Europe  Development Bank credit agreement</strong><br />
In 2014 a seven-year agreement was signed with the  Council of Europe Development Bank (to provide a total of EUR&nbsp;50 million  in credit through Ziraat Finansal Kiralama, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s leasing subsidiary.  Having been transferred to Ziraat Bank in 2015, the first tranches of this  credit were then turned over to ZFK. Under the terms of the credit agreement,  at least 15% of the total amount must be lent to businesses that are operating  in Turkey&rsquo;s priority-development regions.</p>
	<p>The main goal of this program is to enable micro-,  small-, and medium-sized businesses active in many different endeavors such as  manufacturing, construction, agroindustry, tourism, trade, and logistics to  undertake productive investments and also to meet their working capital  requirements for such investments. Other objectives include helping these  businesses create new jobs and improving their ability to protect existing  ones, creating a positive social impact, and supporting the leasing industry.</p>
	<p><strong>World Bank credit for  SMEs and larger-sized enterprises</strong><br />
		Funding received from the World Bank is used to  support small businesses (those that employ no more than 250 people) and  medium-sized businesses (those that employ no more than 1,500 people) by  meeting their needs for investment and working capital, overcoming difficulties  in obtaining credit, and helping them to create jobs.</p>
	<p>World Bank credit is characterized by lengthy grace  periods, flexible repayment options, long terms, and low cost, which makes it  suitable as a source of both investment and operating capital. Lending under  this USD&nbsp;200 million line of credit, the agreement for which was  originally signed in 2010, was successfully completed in the first quarter of  2015.</p>
	<p>During 2015 Ziraat Bank also continued to provide  financing under two other agreements signed with the World Bank:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A USD&nbsp;67 million line of credit which is being  used to finance the energy-efficiency investments of SMEs and larger-sized  enterprises,</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>A USD&nbsp;300 million line of credit which is being  supplied to SMEs both through leasing companies and through banks licensed to  provide leasing products and services.	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Besides supporting SMEs in their efforts to grow,  these agreements also give leasing companies convenient access to the medium-  and long-term funding that they need.</p>
	<p><strong>European Investment Bank  credit financing for SMEs and larger-sized enterprises</strong><br />
		In 2015 Ziraat Bank began lending from the second  EUR&nbsp;100 million tranche of a EUR&nbsp;200 million line of credit which it  had obtained under an agreement with the European Investment Bank to finance  SMEs and larger-sized enterprises.</p>
	<p>As per the agreement, this credit is being used both  to support borrowers&rsquo; efforts to pursue growth by increasing output,  productivity, and employment and to provide them with the investment and operating  capital they need. Another stated objective is to help reduce interregional  disparities in development levels.</p>
	<p>EIB approved this EUR&nbsp;200 million line of credit  based on Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s previous success in other projects of this nature. Under  an agreement signed with EIB in May 2015, Ziraat Bank continued to lend  investment and operating capital to SMEs and larger-sized enterprises from the  first EUR&nbsp;100 million tranche as well.</p>
	<p>Seeking other ways in which to extend the scope of its  collaboration with EIB into other areas as well, in September 2014 Ziraat Bank  signed a EUR&nbsp;100 million Instrument For Pre-Accession Assistance In Rural  Development (IPARD) agreement with EIB to finance rural development projects in  Turkey. This funding, which is to be used to finance projects that comply with  terms set out by the Turkish Agricultural and Rural Development Support Agency,  is also the first IPARD agreement that EIB has entered into with a bank in  Turkey. In 2015 Ziraat Bank began supplying micro-, small-, medium-sized, and  larger businesses in order to help overcome rural areas&rsquo; difficulty in gaining  access to financing.</p>
<p><strong>Saudi Export Program  credit</strong><br />
In 2013 Ziraat Bank secured a USD&nbsp;50 million line  of credit from the Saudi Export Program to finance the importation of goods of  Saudi Arabian origin into Turkey. Disbursements continued successfully in 2015.  Under this SEP program, customers who import a wide range of goods other than  petroleum from Saudi Arabia are provided with low-cost financing on terms of up  to three years to pay for them.</p>
<p><strong>German Development Bank  (KfW) credit</strong><br />
	In 2014 Ziraat Bank signed a 10-year agreement with  the German Development Bank (KfW) to supply EUR&nbsp;150 million in financing  to SMEs that are located in rural areas or are part of the agricultural  value-creation chain. Under this agreement credit is now being provided to  micro-, small-, and medium-sized customers whose businesses are located in  priority-development regions or in a few other localities that are stipulated  in the agreement. The&nbsp;goals of this KfW project are to help reduce  interregional disparities in development levels by providing Ziraat Bank  customers with access to investment and operating capital.</p>
<p><strong>KOSGEB Support Programs</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank and the Small and Medium Enterprises Development  Organization (KOSGEB) have entered into an agreement to give businesses that  apply to that agency under its support programs easier access to sources of  financing. Under the terms of this protocol, financing is provided if the  application has been or will be supported by KOSGEB. Since 2011, the protocol  has also been covering businesses that take part in KOSGEB&rsquo;s SME Loan Interest  Support programs.</p>
<p>The protocol covers the KOSGEB R&amp;D, Innovation  &amp; Industrial Application Support Program and the KOSGEB Cooperation &amp;  Alliance Support Program as well as some others. Businesses taking part in such  programs qualify for reductions of up to 20% on the interest charged on the  cash loans they receive from Ziraat Bank.</p>
<p>Qualifying businesses benefit from reductions of up to  100% on many banking products and services (such as EFT etc.) that they avail  themselves through the Bank&rsquo;s non-branch banking channels. They may also take  advantage of lower rates on loans financed from funding secured by Ziraat Bank  from such sources as the European Investment Bank, the World Bank Energy  Efficiency Program, the French Development Agency, and the German Development  Bank.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacy Support Package</strong><br />
	On 23&nbsp;March&nbsp;2015, Ziraat Bank introduced its  &ldquo;Pharmacy Support Package&rdquo; and began offering it to pharmacists whose Social  Security Corporation collections and payments are made through the Bank. This  comprehensive package of advantageous banking and credit products and services  is designed both to assist the country&rsquo;s pharmacies and pharmacists and to  support the Bank in its efforts to achieve leadership in this business line.</p>
<p><strong>No-Barriers Support  Package</strong><br />
	In April 2015 Ziraat Bank introduced its &ldquo;No-Barriers  Support Package&rdquo;, the aim of which is to support the business endeavors of the  physically handicapped by providing them with the financing they need in order  to play a bigger role in the national economy.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank No-Barriers Support Package contains a  variety of advantageous banking products and is offered to: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Sole proprietorships that belong to individuals who  can prove that they lack at least 40% of their physical capacity but are  nevertheless in full possession of their legal rights and capacity to act;  commercial concerns in which such individuals own at least a 10% share</li>
	<li>Firms that employ at least one more physically  handicapped person than they are required to under the Labor Code</li>
	<li>Firms that employee at least one physically  handicapped person even though they are not by law obliged to do so.	</li>

	<p><strong>Credit Guarantee Fund  collaboration</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank has signed a new protocol with Credit  Guarantee Fund Incorporated (KGF) setting out principles and procedures  pertaining to the guarantees of credit products supplied under the fund&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Portfolio Guarantee System&rdquo;. To date, a total of TL&nbsp;40 million worth of  KGF guarantees have been provided for loans made to SMEs operating in  priority-development regions.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Women  Entrepreneurs Support Package</strong><br />
		On 4&nbsp;December&nbsp;2015 Ziraat Bank launched the  &ldquo;Ziraat Women Entrepreneurs Support Package&rdquo;, whose aim is to help women  entrepreneurs to play a bigger role in the national economy by supporting their  business activities.</p>
	<p> This package consists of an assortment of banking  and/or credit products and services which have been put together with a focus  on encouraging women to go into business and on strengthening their presence in  economic and social life. The&nbsp;package is offered both to sole  proprietorships that belong to women and to companies at least 50% of whose  share capital belongs to partners who are women.</p>
	<p>Under another agreement between Ziraat Bank and the  Credit Guarantee Fund, KGF support may be provided to women taking advantage of  the Ziraat Women Entrepreneurs Support Package who are in need of guarantees to  cover loans they borrow from the Bank.</p>

		While Ziraat Bank provides financial support in line  with national agricultural policy for projects that will encourage investment  in strategic products and/or production methods whose added value is high,  which need to be introduced, or whose availability needs to be increased, that  is not all that it does. The&nbsp;Bank also supplies financial solutions whose  terms, repayment methods, and attractive pricing can be tailored according to  every product and/or production model in line with every producer&rsquo;s needs and  wishes.<br />
		<br />
	<strong>The importance of the  contract production model</strong><br />
		The contract production model is of the utmost  importance to the integration of those who produce agricultural products and  those who use them as industrial inputs. While resolving producers&rsquo; marketing  problems, this model also ensures that manufacturers have convenient and  reliable access to consistent-quality produce. Ziraat Bank gives special  importance to the contract production model when financing projects that  involve the production of things like fresh fruits &amp; vegetables, tomato  paste, sugar beets, poultry, and seed stock for which the model is especially  apt.</p>
	<p><strong>Collaboration with  agricultural associations</strong><br />
		Besides granting convenient access to credit and  advantageous term, guarantee, and pricing conditions to producers who sell  their produce through associations of which they are members or in which they  are partners, Ziraat Bank also encourages producers to join agricultural  associations in order to benefit from the associations&rsquo; marketing, storage, and  pricing opportunities.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank takes part in the congresses, symposiums,  workshops, training programs, and similar activities organized by producers&rsquo;  associations. The&nbsp;Bank demonstrates its willingness to aid the sector and  its representatives by analyzing problems and coming up with solutions.<br />

	<ul>
		<li>Branches</li>
		<li>ATMs</li>
		<li>Internet and mobile banking applications</li>
		<li>Ziraat Bank Call Center </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under the heading of Ziraat Bank retail banking,  efforts to address the needs and expectations of different retail banking  segments, to enhance customer relationship management, to improve business  processes, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations gained additional  momentum in 2015.</p>
	<p>For the development of the Bank&rsquo;s customer-focused  business model, a Retail Banking Project has been launched in order to make  Ziraat Bank the primary financial institution that its customers prefer and one  capable of giving them a satisfaction-based banking experience through an  approach that addresses their financial needs in an integrated way.</p>

	<p><strong>A retail credit pricing module and a commission refund module were brought online in  2015.</strong><br />
A new retail credit pricing module that allows retail  credit products to be precisely priced according to specific criteria became  operational at all Ziraat Bank branches last year. The&nbsp;benefits of this  model are that it facilitates price transparency and standardization,  rationalizes and objectifies credit application assessment, suggests price  ranges based on such parameters as customer and product particulars and bank  policies, simplifies task and approval workflows, and shows the impact of  pricing decisions on portfolio profitability.</p>
	<p>Another new application that went into use in 2015 was  the Commission Refund Module. This module reduces the operational workloads  involved in refunding mandatory service commission fees on subsidized loans  etc. through the use of standardized templates. This module also ensures that  refund processes are properly checked and systematically recorded. </p>
	<p><strong>New product packages</strong><br />
		Three new product packages have been introduced for  customers who receive their salary or pension payments through a Ziraat Bank  account. Intended to increase customer loyalty, the contents of each package  have been designed taking into consideration different customer group&rsquo;s product  and service preferences and the degree to which products are owned and actively  used.</p>
	<p><strong>Regulatory compliance</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank has achieved full compliance with all of  the changes in the regulatory framework that were introduced by new rules  pertaining to consumer credit contracts and mortgage contracts that went into  effect in 2015.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank has also brought itself into compliance  with the requirements of the E-Commerce Regulation Act (Statute 6563)  concerning such matters as obtaining customers&rsquo; permission in order to  communicate with them by e-mail, SMS, and telephone.</p>
	<p> <strong>New business and  customer acquisition</strong><br />
		In 2015 efforts were made to ascertain, based on  available sectoral data and information about public-sector payments, the  dimensions of Ziraat Bank customers&rsquo; financial transactions that did not flow  through the Bank itself. In March of the year a project was launched both to  direct increasingly more of such business to the Bank while also seeking to  attract new customers as well.</p>
	<p>In the third quarter another project was initiated to  develop a customer product-propensity model that allows retail customers&rsquo; needs  to be determined proactively so as to ensure that the right products are  offered to the right customers. As a result of this, it is now possible to  display product offers and customer-based product-propensity scores on customer  profile and portfolio management screens. </p>

	<p>Ways other than repo in which Ziraat Bank seeks to diversify the  structure, lengthen the maturity, and reduce the cost of its funding include  syndicated loans, bilateral lending agreements, funding from IFIs, Eurobond  issues, and a global medium term note program. Besides ensuring that the Bank  has access to the funds it needs to finance its balance sheet assets, funding  diversification also balances the Bank&rsquo;s risk exposure and contributes to its  profitability.</p>
	<p>Continuing to manage its marketable securities portfolio in line with  its core strategies in 2015, the share of both Turkish-lira and  foreign-currency securities in total securities portfolio was reduced from  26.1% in 2014 to 21.4% in 2015.</p>
	<p>A designated primary dealer in the Turkish government debt market,  Ziraat Bank continued to successfully maintain that position in 2015.  The&nbsp;Bank played an active role not only in the primary market but also in  secondary markets, where it traded on behalf of its own customers as well as  for national and international financial institutions. As a result of such  trading last year the Bank ranked second, as measured by total transaction  volume in the Borsa İstanbul Debt Securities Market, for which performance it  was awarded by the exchange.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s FX trading was up by 29% year-on in 2015. </p>
	<p><strong>Syndicated loans diversify  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s strong funding capabilities</strong><br />
		In 2015 Ziraat Bank conducted its third syndicated loan. Forty-one banks  from 19 countries took part in the syndication when it was undertaken in April.  Coordinated by Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, the deal  secured for Ziraat Bank a total of USD&nbsp;1.1 billion in two tranches, one  with a 354-day maturity at 6-month LIBOR/EURIBOR + 0.70% and the other with a  367-day maturity at 6-month LIBOR/EURIBOR + 0.80%.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank will be using this funding in its ongoing efforts to  effectively support its customers through the increasingly broader and more  diversified range of foreign trade finance products and services that it  offers.</p>
	<p><strong>GMTN Program limit  increased to USD&nbsp;4 billion</strong><br />
		In line with its efforts to diversify its resource structure and to  lengthen its borrowing maturities, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Global Medium Term Note (GMTN)  Program limit was increased and updated to USD&nbsp;4 billion on  2&nbsp;April&nbsp;2015. Under this program, which makes it possible to issue  notes in different currencies and at a variety of maturities, Ziraat Bank  secured USD&nbsp;637.7 million and EUR&nbsp;137.7 million worth of funding in  44 international private placements which were undertaken during the remainder  of the year.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s funding  management approach and the increasing importance of saving</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s liability-management strategy is rooted in the principle  of diversifying and deepening its non-deposit resources on the one hand while  concurrently expanding its own deposit base on the other. One way in which the Bank seeks to increase both its customer numbers  and its broadly-based deposit balance is to encourage saving by offering a wide  range of deposit products.</p>
	<p> Ziraat Bank believes that, owing in part to changes in the legal  framework, the propensity to save among the public at large will increase in  2016 and for this reason the Bank is developing products that will encourage  its customers to put their savings to work on a long-term basis. Two of the savings  accounts products that the Bank plans to introduce in 2016 are a &ldquo;Trousseau  Account&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Home-Ownership Account&rdquo;. Both accounts qualify for advantageous  state contributions if their maturity is at least three years.</p>
	<p><strong>The success of &ldquo;Ziraat  Bank Gold Time&rdquo; </strong><br />
		The &ldquo;Gold Time&rdquo; program that Ziraat Bank launched in 2013 continued to  successfully encourage customers to convert their physical gold assets into  gold-based savings products. About 4.2 tons of gold have been brought into the  formal banking system as a result of this program.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank has long been one of the sector&rsquo;s leading proponents of gold  banking. As of end-2015, 12.4 tons worth of gold were held in the Bank&rsquo;s gold  deposit accounts. Ziraat Bank also makes it easy for customers to trade in gold  through their investment accounts.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Finance Group  mutual funds: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one just right for you!&rdquo;</strong><br />
		The Ziraat Finance Group investment funds controlled by Ziraat Bank and  its subsidiaries outperformed sectoral growth averages in 2015.</p>
	<p>Marketed under the &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s just right for you!&rdquo; slogan,  Ziraat Finance Group investment funds are capable of appealing to a broad range  of investors with different risk profiles. The&nbsp;group&rsquo;s stock (equity) fund  grew by 30.9% in 2015, a year in which the sectoral average was just 5.4%, and  reached a total value of TL&nbsp;3.18 billion at year-end. During the same  twelve months, the ZFG funds&rsquo; combined investor base grew from 193,622 to  234,565.</p>
	<p>When private pension funds are also taken into account, the investment  funds industry grew by 16.7% overall in 2015. The&nbsp;Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s  investment funds by comparison grew by 42.1% and reached a total value of  TL&nbsp;4.64 billion during the same period. </p>
	<p><strong>Complying with CMB  regulations</strong><br />
		Another important development in 2015 took place when, in compliance  with Capital Markets Board regulations, ten investment funds set up by Ziraat  Bank and four investment funds set up by Ziraat Yatırım were turned over to  Ziraat Portföy Yönetimi (ZPY), a specialist portfolio management firm.</p>
	<p>Under a CMB license that was obtained to provide portfolio custody  services, such services are now being provided for twenty-one investment funds  belonging to members of the Ziraat Finance Group. The&nbsp;scope of this  license is such that ZPY may provide these services for all collective  investment schemes, not just those belonging to ZFG members. Fund-management  services are also being provided by ZPY to the same twenty-one funds as per the  CMB license.</p>
	<p><strong>Seven new mutual funds  were launched.</strong><br />
		In order to diversify the range of collective investment options that  are made available to Ziraat Finance Group customers, last year seven new  mutual funds were added to the existing lineup. These are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>A hedge fund</li>
		<li>A fund of funds</li>
		<li>A real estate investment trust equity fund</li>
		<li>A sharia-compliant hedge fund</li>
		<li>A sharia-compliant equity fund</li>
		<li>A sharia-compliant FX fund</li>
		<li>A sharia-compliant lease certificate participation  fund.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Of the seven newly-launched funds, the last four were introduced as  alternatives for customers who prefer interest-free collective investment  schemes.</p>

	<p><strong>Safe hands for customers&rsquo;  assets</strong><br />
The aggregate value of all retail customer portfolios for which  portfolio custody services were being provided as of end-2015 was TL&nbsp;2.89  billion. Similarly the combined value of retail customer portfolios for which  Ziraat Portföy Yönetimi was providing general custody services was  TL&nbsp;2,887 million as of the same date.</p>
	<p><strong>Turkish Electronic Fund  Trading Platform: More effective access to investment funds</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank customers can use their Ziraat Bank investment accounts to  trade in the shares of investment funds belonging to other banks, brokerages,  and portfolio management companies via the Turkey Electronic Fund Trading  Platform (TEFAS), a central electronic platform that is shared by all of the  investment funds traded in Turkey. Similarly, investors who are not Ziraat Bank  customers can also trade in ZFG investment funds through the same platform.</p>
	<p><strong>Continuous, regular  investment with a single instruction</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank customers may now issue instructions to purchase shares in  all ZFG investment fund on a regular basis, a service that previously was  available only to those who placed standing orders to purchase shares in a ZPY  fund designed to encourage saving among children. When issuing such  instructions, customers may specify what shares are to be purchased in what  quantities every month.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank capital market  licenses have been renewed.</strong><br />
		As required by CMB regulations, Ziraat Bank applied to that agency to  have its capital market licenses renewed. The&nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s applications were  approved at two CMB meetings on 7&nbsp;December and 28&nbsp;December of last  year. As a result of these renewals, Ziraat Bank is currently authorized to  engage in the investment activities and to provide the primary and ancillary  investment services indicated below.</p>

	<h1>Strong and sustainable relationships with correspondents, superiorquality service, and high value added products are the fundamental reasons why Ziraat Bank is an increasingly preferred partner in foreign trade finance.</h1>
	<p><strong>International Relations  that Enhance Customer Value</strong></p>
	<p> In keeping with its customer-focused business model, Ziraat Bank  cooperates with international financial institutions in order to provide its  customers with financial solutions which are both appropriate and create value.</p>
	<p>As of end-2015, Ziraat Bank had correspondent relationships with about  1,770 banks in more than 130 countries.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank continuously expands its extensive correspondent network and  deepens its bilateral relationships in order to keep pace both with customer  demand and with changes and trends in the global economy.</p>
	<p>Thanks to the synergistic collaboration that arises from a strong  correspondent network, the Bank has the ability to provide global-scale trade  intermediation services and to develop bespoke solutions no matter what its  customers&rsquo; foreign trade finance requirements may be. Strong and sustainable  relationships with correspondents, superior-quality service, and high value  added products are the fundamental reasons why Ziraat Bank is an increasingly  preferred partner in foreign trade finance.</p>
	<p>The consistent growth in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s share of Turkey&rsquo;s foreign trade  finance remained on course in 2015, with the Bank ranking among the leading  players in this business line as of year-end. Ziraat Bank registered about a  30% rate of growth in the number of customers for which it provided foreign  trade finance product and service last year and was involved in deals involving  more than 150 countries.</p>
	<p>Under the heading of foreign trade finance, Ziraat Bank offers products  such as letter of credit discounting and endorsed bill discounting. It works  closely with such export credit agencies as Hermes, COFACE, SERV, and SACE in  order to give its customers access to their medium- and long-term country  credit resources.</p>

		With branches, subsidiaries, and representatives at 97 locations in 18  countries around the world, Ziraat Bank continues to strengthen its position as  the center of a service network whose international reach is more extensive  than that of any other Turkish bank.</p>

		<li>To effectively exploit synergies in keeping with the  underlying principles of the Ziraat Finance Group.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Expanding our global reach  and effectiveness</strong><br />
		Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s goal is to be Turkey&rsquo;s and its region&rsquo;s strongest and most  active bank as it continues to exploit the dynamics of developments in global  and local markets and to take advantage of business potential and opportunities  that arise in every territory in which it has a presence.</p>
	<p>2015 developments in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s oversees branch banking activities  are summarized below.</p>
	<p> The Bank&rsquo;s Pristina branch in <strong>Kosovo</strong> commenced  operations on 8&nbsp;June&nbsp;2015. Work is currently in progress to open a  second branch in the city of Prizren.</p>
	<p>Work is currently in progress to open a branch in <strong>Bahrain</strong>, which is the first step in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s plan  to build up a presence in the Gulf Region. This branch is expected to commence  operations by midyear 2016.</p>
	<p>With an eye on the particular dynamics and needs of <strong>London</strong> as a financial center, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s London  branch has been reorganized so as to expand its product and service 
		range and to increase its effectiveness especially in  such business lines as secondary market trading, structured finance, and  foreign trade finance.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s operations in <strong>Bulgaria</strong> consist of four branches located one each in  the cities of Sofia, Plovdiv, Kardzhali, and Varna. Work is in progress to  broaden the Bank&rsquo;s presence in the country by enlarging the reach of its ATM  network and online banking, non-branch, and alternative delivery channels.</p>
	<p>In <strong>Greece</strong>, Ziraat Bank  currently has an operational presence at four locations in the form of its  Athens, Komotini, Xanthi, and Rhodes branches.</p>
	<p>In <strong>Northern Cyprus  (TRNC)</strong>, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s customer- and market-focused operations are conducted  through ten branches, which are giving increasingly greater attention to  product line expansion and service quality improvement. Loans to farmers, which  were introduced in 2011, have been attracting much attention and reached about  TL&nbsp;63 million in value at end-2015, as of which date total lending to all  customers in this market amounted to TL&nbsp;672 million. Not only are TRNC  branches able to provide the same banking products and services as their  siblings in Turkey, they also position the Ziraat brand among the country&rsquo;s  leading banks as measured by size and profitability and continue to play an  important role in Northern Cyprus&rsquo;s economic development.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Tbilisi branch in <strong>Georgia</strong> first opened  its doors for business in 2001. In line with the Bank&rsquo;s core goal and strategy  of increasing the Ziraat brand&rsquo;s regional clout and pursuing growth in Turkey&rsquo;s  near abroad, a sub-branch was opened in the city of Batumi in 2013. Work is  currently in progress to open a third branch, to be located in the city of  Marneuli, and it is planned to have it commence operations by midyear 2016.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s <strong>Jeddah</strong> branch has  been in business since 14&nbsp;March&nbsp;2011. While providing letters of  guarantee for Turkish contractors in the country remains an important business  line, the branch is seeking to expand its product and service capabilities in  order to satisfy the banking needs of Saudi as well as Turkish corporate and  retail customers.</p>
	<p>Having first gained a presence in <strong>Iraq</strong> when it opened  a branch in Baghdad in 2008, on 14&nbsp;February&nbsp;2011 Ziraat Bank became  the first Turkish bank to open a branch in the city of Erbil. Last year  Ziraat&rsquo;s branches continued to play an increasingly greater role in issuing  letters of guarantee for Turkish contractors active in the region and in  processing money transfers for Turkish companies and nationals in Iraq.</p>

In 2015, 136,423 Ziraat Bank employees took part in  e-learning activities in support of their regular classroom training. Last year  a project was completed to make the Bank&rsquo;s new training management app  accessible to all personnel from both inside and outside the Bank&rsquo;s premises.
