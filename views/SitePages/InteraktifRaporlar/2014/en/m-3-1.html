</div>

<div class="sag">
	<p>The internal audit,  internal control and risk management activities at Ziraat Bank are carried out  by the Board of Auditors and Internal Control and Risk Management Group, which  have segregated duties and responsibilities, are organizationally independent  from each other, but work under the coordination of Internal Systems Assistant  General Manager Office.</p>
	<p>Set up to cover all  units, branches and the Bank&rsquo;s subsidiaries subject to audit, the organization  aims to ensure complete and secure pursuance of banking activities, realization  of long-term profit targets, reliable financial and administrative reporting,  and minimization of unexpected risks that might negatively affect the Bank&rsquo;s  reputation and financial stability.</p>
	<p><strong>Operation of the Internal  Audit System</strong> <br />
		The Board of Auditors  adopts a risk-focused approach to auditing and monitors the compliance of the  activities carried out by all of the Bank&rsquo;s head office units, domestic and  international branches, and subsidiaries under its control with the law and  other applicable legislation, as well as the Bank&rsquo;s internal strategy, policy,  principles and targets. The&nbsp;Board of Auditors keeps the Bank&rsquo;s Senior  Management informed and pursues its efforts in a manner to contribute to the  decision-making processes of the Senior Management.</p>
	<p>Having 184 members and  working in line with the international internal audit standards, in 2014 the  Board of Auditors audited and evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of  transaction steps that make up the primary processes, and the secondary  processes, besides auditing the compliance of the Bank&rsquo;s activities with the  processes that they are governed under. In&nbsp;addition, the Bank&rsquo;s IT  Inspectors audited the processes set out in the Regulation on Bank Information  Systems and Banking Processes published by the Banking Regulation and  Supervision Agency (BRSA) in line with the Bank&rsquo;s implementations.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Centralized Audit Team, which operates under the Board of  Auditors and plays a key role by applying various scenario analyses to identify  realized irregularities and by producing a dissuasive effect on possible  irregularities in order to prevent them continued its activities in 2014.</li>
		<li>R&amp;D team carried out activities for revising processes and  legislation by closely monitoring business processes of Board of Auditors and  the Bank&rsquo;s all other units. Completed audit reports were analyzed and shared  with related units if necessary. Laws, BRSA decisions, and changes that are  proposed by the Bank&rsquo;s senior management and Head Office units were closely  monitored and audit points are kept updated by doing so.</li>
		<li>Scenario Team was formed in order to produce scenarios and offer  quick and effective solution for the Bank by applying these scenarios in line  with detecting deficiencies in the Bank&rsquo;s processes, improving processes and  increasing efficiency. This team carried out very important projects in 2014.  Their works are offered to use of the Bank&rsquo;s units and were helpful in taking  several important actions.</li>
		<li>Central Audit Team which was formed to increase audit frequency  of certain branch groups by monitoring them from the center continuously and  which was formed to increase efficiency started its operations. In&nbsp;2014,  244 branches were audited in line with the same principles that are applied to  on-site audit.</li>
		<li>Management Declaration which was prepared to offer guarantee  about effectiveness, adequacy and compliance of internal audit on information  systems and banking processes; which was prepared for the first time in 2011  was offered to independent audit firm in January. With Management Declaration  application, offering a guarantee regarding current situation and activities  that are carried out is aimed by enabling Board of Directors to evaluate  effectiveness, adequacy and compliance of the Bank&rsquo;s internal audit on  information systems and banking processes from the perspective of Information  Systems Audit period.</li>
		<li>Information Systems and Banking Processes Audit Guide is  prepared in line with Regulation on Bank Information Systems and Banking  Processes Audit that will be Carried Out by Independent Auditors which was  published on Official Gazette numbered 27461 and dated 13&nbsp;January 2010.</li>
		<li>Risk points of branches are determined by giving weights- in  certain periods- to each criteria that were set as a result of the Committee&rsquo;s  works. Risky branches were determined as a result of this work. These branches  were prioritized in audit planning. (Branch Risk Work)</li>
		<li>Within the scope of Virtual Archive project, inspectors were  provided with e-signatures. Reports are started to be signed with e-signatures  and wet signature process was terminated.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The inspectors have the  opportunity to conduct audit in different units periodically and thereby  constantly build on their professional knowledge and experience; they were also  given training at certain intervals to support their personal and professional  development in 2014.</p>
	<p>Inspectors are encouraged  to take on administrative duties, thus continuing to supply qualified human  resources to the Bank&rsquo;s administrative personnel. In&nbsp;addition, 54  assistant inspectors who were hired in 2014 started to work.</p>
	<p>As a result of The Board  of Inspectors&rsquo; evaluation of organizational changes at the Bank, the modules  introduced in lending decisions, and the systematic differences arising from  the launch of centralized allocation structure, New Auditing Model that  includes all business processes is started to be used. Results of the audit  were presented to the all units of the Bank.</p>
	<p>With Finding Follow-Up  Mechanism, a consciousness of fulfilling/correcting deficiencies that are  subject to findings within certain period is started to be created without  satisfying only reporting these findings that were obtained during audit.</p>
	<p>In the coming period, the  Board of Auditors will continue to be guided by a high sense of responsibility  and duty in the execution of the internal audit plan to be devised in line with  the targets and policies determined by the Bank&rsquo;s Senior Management and within  the framework of the modern approach to auditing; in the reporting of their  outcomes to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee and in  monitoring the precautions to be adopted based on audit reports.</p>
	<p><strong>Operation of the Internal  Control and Compliance System</strong><br />
		Internal control  activities are organized in such a way to cover the activities of the Bank&rsquo;s  domestic and international branches and head office units under the Regulation  on Banks&rsquo; Internal Systems and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and  are constantly revised in line with the Bank&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
	<p>The scope and  implementation of the approach are in line with the Bank&rsquo;s main goals and  strategies. After the change in risk perceptions and a new service model  implementation, a proactive structure is adopted in accordance with the changes  in the strategy and circumstances. Within this scope, the Bank made efforts for  New Control mode and started to use this model. Thanks to this adopted proactive  structure, the Bank&rsquo;s operations are performed at higher standards than the  sector norms in accordance with both domestic and international codes and  competitive conditions.</p>
	<p>Domestic branch controls  are carried out on-site and from the center within the framework of program  that is prepared each period according to risk status.</p>
	<p>Internal control  activities at all of our international branches are conducted in accordance  with the annual control plans that are approved by our Committee.</p>
	<p>The control intervals at  head office units are determined in view of the units&rsquo; functions and risk  exposure, their job descriptions and their impact on the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet,  and are revised in line with the Bank&rsquo;s needs.<br />
		The findings contained in  the reports prepared following these activities are categorized under certain  headings, and are shared with relevant units and the Senior Management.</p>
	<p>In 2014, on-site Internal  Controllers continued to conduct examinations regarding matters established  during the control activities and which were deemed to require further  examination. The&nbsp;necessary action to be taken by the Bank based on the  preliminary examination reports was taken and transactions which were suspected  of being subject to abuse were shared with the Board of Auditors in order to  ensure that the necessary examinations/investigations were undertaken.</p>
	<p>In addition to the above,  compliance control activities are also carried out by the internal control  function within the framework of Article 18 of the Regulation on the Banks&rsquo;  Internal Systems and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. Accordingly,  all past or planned activities of the Bank, as well as new products and  transactions are checked for compliance with the Law and other applicable  legislation, internal policies and guidelines, and established banking  practices. Furthermore, regulations that are issued or modified by the Bank are  also reviewed within the scope of compliance controls and resulting opinions  are shared with the related units.</p>
	<p>Besides control  activities, recommendation reports continued to be issued, which are aimed at  improving the processes related to the activities carried out at the Bank by  Internal Controllers and at prevention of possible risks. The&nbsp;objectives  of this implementation are to prevent risks by identifying them in advance,  improving processes so as to achieve alignment with the competitive environment  and customer satisfaction, and taking cost saving measures.</p>
	<p>Internal Controllers are  encouraged to take on administrative duties, thus continuing to supply  qualified human resources to the Bank&rsquo;s administrative personnel.</p>
	<p><strong>Operation of the Risk  Management System</strong><br />
		The fundamental approach  to risk management activities carried out at the Bank is to achieve the best  possible practices in risk management functions by inculcating a culture of  risk-awareness throughout the Bank and by continuously improving both the  system and the human resources according to Regulation on the Banks&rsquo; Internal  Systems and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.</p>
	<p>The utmost attention is  taken towards ensuring that the risk management activities undertaken are  conducted with the coordinated participation of all units that are involved in  every activity associated with each category of risk. Risk management  activities cover the main headings of credit risk, market risk, operational  risk and balance sheet risks (interest rate risk arising from banking accounts  and liquidity risk), and have the ultimate objective of achieving compliance  with international best practices.</p>
	<p>Under credit risk  management activities, work is undertaken to define, measure, monitor and  report credit risk, employing methods that are in alignment with Basel II.  In&nbsp;this context, legal reporting process started using the Basel II  Standardized Method from 1&nbsp;July 2012. The&nbsp;amount of credit risk is  reported to the BRSA each month on a solo basis and quarterly on a consolidated  basis.<br />
		Efforts are ongoing at  the Bank to measure the creditworthiness in connection with advanced measurement  methods. Accordingly, work is being carried out on the outcomes of scoring  models used for different loan portfolios. Validation is carried out using  statistical methods to measure the accuracy and performance of these scoring  models. Furthermore, credit risk limits that are approved by the Board of  Directors are monitored, and work is in progress to conduct scenario analyses  and stress testing for the non-performing loans ratio. Methods that are in  alignment with Basel III have been prepared and will be implemented in the new  operational year.</p>
	<p>Under the operational  risk management activities, operational risks are defined, classified, measured  and analyzed. These analyses are supported with stress tests. Moreover,  operational risk limits that are approved by the Board of Directors are  followed periodically. The&nbsp;operational risk loss database in the Finart  environment allows incidents of operational risk to be tracked. Risks arising  from information technology and actions taken are followed up. An Operational  Risk Map is being prepared for use in the Internal Control audit program for  the purpose of establishing the risk levels of the Bank&rsquo;s branches.  In&nbsp;addition, risk exposure assessments are conducted for companies  providing outsourced support services within the framework of the BRSA&rsquo;s  regulations in force.</p>
	<p>Within the scope of  market and balance sheet risk management activities, market risk, liquidity  risk, and interest rate risk arising from banking accounts are measured,  analyzed, limited, reported and monitored, and the analyses conducted are  supported through stress tests. In&nbsp;addition, market and liquidity risk  limits which are approved by Board of Directors are followed periodically.  In&nbsp;line with Basel III regulations, Liquidity Coverage Ratio was started  to be calculated pursuant to BRSA regulation. Within the scope of market risk,  backward test analyses are carried out for internal models that are used.</p>
	<p>To determine the amount  of shareholders&rsquo; equity that is aligned with the loss our Bank may sustain due  to its risk exposure, a capital adequacy assessment is conducted using the  economic capital approach and the results are reported to the senior  management.</p>
	<p>The results of the  analyses conducted under risk management activities and the risk indicators are  reported to the Board of Directors and our Committee at six month intervals and  to the executive units and internal system units at monthly, weekly and daily  intervals.</p>
	<p>The new operating period  will be marked by continued activities under all risk categories on the basis  of internationally accepted advanced risk management techniques, as well as  execution of these activities as an integral part of the Bank&rsquo;s strategic  decision making processes.</p>
