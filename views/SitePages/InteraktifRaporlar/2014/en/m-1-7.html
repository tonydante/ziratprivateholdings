	<h1>Ziraat Bank, which supports the Turkish economy in every area, enhanced its leading position in the sector with the Bank’s change and transformation.</h1>
	<h1>There was a considerable amount of divergence in economic growth performance between different regions and countries in 2014.</h1>
	<p>Esteemed  stakeholders,</p>
	<p>There was a  considerable amount of divergence in economic growth performance between  regions and countries in 2014. While the US economy grew strongly, the economic  recovery in Europe remained fragile. Other leading economies such as China and  Japan also faced an economic slowdown. There was a slowdown on the demand side  with the global economy not yet attaining its desired performance and amidst  increased geopolitical risks. These factors also precipitated declines in  commodity prices, especially from the second half of the year.</p>
	<p>The  expansionary policies, which have been implemented to tackle the problems that  have emerged since the global crisis broke out, continued. Key central banks,  primarily the European Central Bank and Japan&rsquo;s central bank, maintained their  expansionary policies amid the slack levels of global growth in 2014.  In&nbsp;contrast with other countries, however, the USA announced exit strategy  from its Quantitative Easing program in response to an improvement in  macro-economic indicators such as growth, employment and inflation. After the  end of the Quantitative Easing, a lift-off is expected in the coming months  with moderate hikes in interest rates. Developing countries, on the other hand,  have been both positively and negatively affected by the movements in commodity  prices, depending on the compositions of their economies.</p>
	<p>While global  markets were mainly watching the steps that will be taken by the USA, with risk  perceptions focused on USA data, the growth performance of the global economy,  market risk perceptions also turned to geopolitical developments and commodity  prices in 2014. A&nbsp;number of different factors started to affect volatility  in the market.</p>
	<p>A variety of  measures needs to be taken and problems need to be tackled to put economies on  the right track. While the European Central Bank maintains its efforts to  revive the economy with methods such as negative interest rates on deposits and  bond purchases, it also struggles with low inflation and high unemployment.  Japanese and Chinese central banks have also taken expansionary steps.  The&nbsp;forthcoming period will not be as easy as planned. The&nbsp;countries  which create permanent solutions at right time will be the ones that emerge  successfully.</p>
	<p>The Turkish  economy, as a part of the global economy, was sensitive to the developments in  the world. While growth was brisk at the beginning of the year, it started to  diminish in the second half of the year. In&nbsp;contrast with the previous  year, growth was mainly driven by foreign demand. The&nbsp;current account  deficit narrowed, but inflation exceeded the expected levels. One development  which supported Turkey, as an energy importer, was the plunge in oil prices  during the year. Lower oil prices will help further lower the current account,  bring down inflation and support growth by decreasing energy costs. It is  thought that domestic and foreign demand conditions will become more balanced,  setting the stage for healthier growth rates going forward.</p>
<h1>Fiscal discipline was maintained in 2014 in what was one of the crowning successes of the Turkish economy.</h1>
	<p>On the other  hand, inflation remained under pressure from the weakness of the Turkish Lira  at the beginning of the year and its pass-through effect on inflation, and also  lower agricultural yields due to the drought in the winter season, and the  resulting increase in food prices. The&nbsp;year 2014 was rounded off with an  8.17% rate of CPI inflation. The&nbsp;rate of inflation is expected to enter a  declining trend again on the back of the base effect from the spike observed in  2014, which was temporary, the normalization in food prices and the decline in  oil prices.</p>
	<p>The current  account deficit, which is one of the key structural problems facing Turkey,  exhibited a downward trend in 2014. The&nbsp;decrease in domestic demand after  the macro-prudential measures that were initiated at the beginning of the year  and the resulting decrease in demand for imports had an impact on this  situation. Another factor behind the improvement in the current account deficit  was the increase in exports to Europe, which is Turkey&rsquo;s most important export  market, as a result of the economic recovery seen at the beginning of the year.  However, factors such as the deceleration in global economic growth and  geopolitical risks threaten this improvement. To this end, the decline in the  energy import bill, which has come on the back of the slump in oil prices, will  no doubt prove supportive. Maintaining the improvement in the current account  balance is likely, assuming that oil prices remain near their current levels  throughout 2015.</p>
	<p>Fiscal  discipline was maintained in 2014 in what was one of the crowning successes of  the Turkish economy. There were no deviations from the targets despite two  elections held during the year. The&nbsp;year was concluded in line with the  targets set out in the Medium Term Program. There was no compromise in  maintaining the fiscal policies that have been conducted for year.<br />
		The Central  Bank continues to implement a tight monetary policy. Price stability is now  more crucial against a backdrop of inflation volatility. Following the hike in  interest rates implemented in response to the volatility in the TL at the  beginning of 2014, there was a limited reduction in interest rates in the  second half of the year in response to some improvement in conditions.  A&nbsp;further decline in interest rates is expected in 2015 on the back of a  sharper decline in inflation, especially in the first half of the year.</p>
	<p>The Turkish  Banking sector enjoyed a positive performance in 2014, even though both global and  domestic conditions deteriorated. The&nbsp;sector&rsquo;s balance sheet can be  considered satisfactory, despite having grown at a slower rate than in the  previous year. Profitability in the sector approached its 2013 level. As far as  loans are concerned, while retail loan growth slowed, corporate loan growth  remained brisk, in an indication of continued support for the real sector.</p>
<h1>Another important development in 2014 was the approval and announcement of Ziraat Bank’s Sustainability Policy.</h1>
	<p>Ziraat Bank,  which supports the Turkish economy in every area, enhanced its leading position  in the sector with the Bank&rsquo;s change and transformation. In&nbsp;2014, the Bank  took strong steps for the coming years with the help of a more effective and  efficient balance sheet structure. The&nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s activities are always  focused on its vision of always moving towards a better position.</p>
	<p>Another important  development in 2014 was the approval and announcement of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  Sustainability Policy. Our first Sustainability Report, published during the  year, represented an important step as it considers social and economic issues  - which form the latest trends of global banking, as a whole and as it enables  our stakeholders to evaluate our gains and aims.</p>
	<p>On behalf of  myself and our Board of Directors I would like to take this opportunity to  thank everyone who has placed their trust in our customers, employees, business  partners and our brand, and who has provided pecuniary and non-pecuniary  contributions to the value that we generate.</p>
	<p>Yours  sincerely,</p>
