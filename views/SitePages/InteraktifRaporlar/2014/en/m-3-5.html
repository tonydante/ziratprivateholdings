		<p><strong>Risk Management  Policies in Accordance with </strong><strong>Risk  Type</strong><strong> </strong></p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="sag">
	<p>The fundamental approach to risk management is to  achieve the best possible practices in risk management functions by instilling  a culture of risk-awareness throughout the Bank and by continuously improving  both the system and the Bank&rsquo;s human resources.</p>
	<p>Risk management activities cover the primary headings  of credit risk, market risk, operational risk and balance sheet risk. Policy  and implementation principles concerning the management of these risks are  carried out in accordance with the regulations on the basis of each type of  risk, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The&nbsp;utmost attention  is taken to ensure that the risk management activities which take place are  conducted with the coordinated participation of all units that are involved in  every activity associated with the risk categories.</p>
	<p>In order to establish a system to determine the  capital level and the need for capital against the risks that the Bank is  exposed to (or will be exposed to), an Internal Capital Adequacy Evaluation  Process is established in our Bank, in line with strategic goals, within the  framework of the &ldquo;Regulation on the Internal Systems and Internal Capital  Adequacy Assessment Process of the Banks&rdquo;, The analyses, which are in  compliance with the implementation guidelines of the BRSA, are supported with  stress testing and scenario analyses on a risk basis.</p>
	<p>Under the scope of &ldquo;Regulation on Measurement and  Evaluation of Leverage Level of Banks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Regulation on Capital Maintenance  and Cyclical Capital Buffer&rdquo;, which were enacted in 2013, studies are conducted  in alignment with Basel III Regulations.</p>
	<p>In accordance with the Basel-III liquidity  implementations, Liquidity Adequacy Report is started to be submitted to BRSA  in line with the &ldquo;Regulation on Measurement and Evaluation of Liquidity  Adequacy of Banks&rdquo; which was published by the BRSA. Additionally, studies  related to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Rate are  delivered to the Basel Committee in 6-month periods through the BRSA.</p>
	<p><strong>Credit Risk</strong></p>
	<p>Credit risk management involves regulating the Bank&rsquo;s  credit risk exposure and defining, measuring, monitoring, controlling and  reporting these risks.</p>
	<p>Statutory reports are prepared by using standard  approach method within the framework of Regulation on Measuring and Assessing  Banks Capital Adequacy. Within this scope, the amount of credit risk which is  calculated is reported to the BRSA monthly on a solo basis and quarterly on a  consolidated basis. Leverage ratio is submitted to BRSA and CBRT periodically.</p>
	<p>The Bank established the Company Assessment Model so  that related units are able to determine the creditworthiness of customers in  the Commercial, Corporate and Entrepreneurial segments, and the Scoring Model  for establishing the creditworthiness of its customers in the Retail segment.  Validation is carried out to measure the accuracy and performance of these  models using statistical methods. In&nbsp;order to also allow the use of  advanced measurement methods to calculate the amount of credit risk, work is  carried out on the results of the said scoring models.</p>
	<p>Within the scope of Internal Rating Notification  Circular which is enacted as of January 2014, Internal Rating Notifications are  reported to the Banks Association of Turkey&rsquo;s Risk Center on a monthly basis.  Several projects are planned to enable to calculate amount of credit risk with  advanced measurement techniques.</p>
	<p>Following credit risk limits and signal values that  are approved by the Board of Directors are detected: credit risk limits and  signal values on the basis of customers and counterparty credit risk stemmed  from banking accounts on the basis of portfolio and counterparty credit risk  limit and signal values stemmed from trading accounts. These limits and values  are followed monthly. The&nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s risk weighted assets that it can carry on  the bases of segment and portfolio are restrained with these limits.</p>
	<p><strong>Market Risk</strong></p>
	<p>With a view to revealing the market risks that the  Bank may be exposed to, risk measuring and monitoring are carried out, the  results of which are taken into consideration in the Bank&rsquo;s strategic  decision-making process.</p>
	<p>In the market risk control process, the market  developments that affect the current values of &ldquo;portfolios subject to market  risk&rdquo;, which is determined in line with the Bank&rsquo;s trading strategy, are  monitored at least on a daily basis, and the impact of ordinary or  extraordinary downward and upward moves in the markets on the portfolio is  analyzed.</p>
	<p>In an attempt to prevent the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength  from being significantly affected by increased volatility in the markets in the  course of its day-to-day activities, signal values in the early warning system  are monitored and risk levels are restricted within limits.</p>
	<p>The amount of market risk to be included in the legal  capital adequacy ratio is calculated and reported by using the standardized  method. The&nbsp;market risk is measured on a daily basis using the VaR-based  internal method employed in addition to the standardized method, which has been  assessed and endorsed for suitability within the framework of international  best practices by an independent consultancy firm. Moreover, in order to  measure the effectiveness of models that are used, backward test analyses have  been conducted.</p>
	<p><strong>Operational Risk</strong></p>
	<p>Operational risks incurred throughout the Bank are  tracked by means of the Operational Risk Loss Data Base. The&nbsp;amount of  capital required to cover operational risks is calculated according to the  Basic Indicator Approach.</p>
	<p>Our Bank carries out works to set up the integrated  risk mainframe. A&nbsp;database of Information Technology risks was set up,  through which the risks that were found and the actions taken to tackle them  are monitored.</p>
	<p>Within the scope of our Bank&rsquo;s Business Continuity, a  &ldquo;Business Impact Analysis&rdquo; was conducted which evaluated probable risks that  could be caused by potential interruptions in operations and their potential  impacts.</p>
	<p>To ensure a continuity of services obtained from  companies to which support services are outsourced, the Bank started assessing  the risks that might arise from service procurement within the scope of the  Regulation on the Outsourcing of Support Services by Banks published by the  BRSA.</p>
	<p><strong>Balance Sheet Risks</strong></p>
	<p>To reveal the liquidity risk and the interest rate  risks arising from banking accounts that the Bank may be exposed to, risk  measurement and monitoring are carried out, the results of which are taken into  consideration in the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision making process within the scope  of balance sheet risks management.</p>
	<p>Compliance with statutorily-mandated ratios pertaining  to the interest rate risk incurred on liquidity and banking institutional  accounts is monitored. In&nbsp;addition, following items are monitored in  liquidity risk control: maturity mismatch between funds and placements,  behavioral maturities of assets and liabilities besides their contractual  maturities, primary liquid reserve levels that will allow the Bank to pursue  its normal day-to-day activities as well as CBRT liquidity facilities that can  be used to fulfill unexpected liquidity needs and secondary reserves that have  the potential to be liquidated with low price risk. In&nbsp;addition, scenario  and sensitivity analyses are carried out within this framework.</p>
	<p>In interest rate risk control of banking accounts,  analyses and monitoring are carried out on ratio and maturity mismatches  between fixed and variable interest rate funds and placements, as well as in  behavioral maturities and contractual maturities of assets and liabilities, and  into the effects that probable downward or upward changes in interest rates,  either ordinary or extraordinary, will have on the current value of the assets  or liabilities. Turkish lira and foreign currency interest margins are also  watched closely.</p>
	<p>In order to prevent our financial strength from being  significantly affected by increased volatility in the markets and potential  mismatches in cash inflows and outflows during the course of our day-to-day  activities, signal values in the early warning system are monitored and risk  levels are restricted within limits.</p>
