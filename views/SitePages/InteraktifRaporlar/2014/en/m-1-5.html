<div class="sola">
<h4>more efficiency in services</h4>
<h4>strong risk management</h4>
<h4>faster operations</h4>
</div>
	<p><strong>With the perception that change is a never  ending journey, Ziraat Bank keeps changing and moving forward together with its  employees and customers…</strong></p>
	<p>In 2014,  Ziraat Bank uninterruptedly carried out infrastructural and corporate  development projects regarding the &ldquo;Ziraat Customer Business Model&rdquo; which was  designed to fulfill the financial needs of its customers through the right  channels, at the right time, and with the right value propositions.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  maintains its efforts to take its hard won gains through its transformation  journey starting in 2012 to the future, and complete its global transformation  projects. The&nbsp;aim of the transformation project is to bring the Ziraat  Finance Group to the future in three main areas: Corporate Banking, Branch  Banking and International Banking. Under this approach, the Bank has  passionately continued to work and create value within the scope of the 2014  Strategic Road Map which was established to help the Bank reach its strategic  goals, and is followed by the Strategic Guide Committee.</p>
	<p><strong>1. Customer Relationship Management: &ldquo;A  sustainable relationship with customers&rdquo;</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  effected improvement/ progress in all channels through which the Bank contacted  customers throughout 2014, towards its aim of establishing a sustainable  relationship with its customers.</p>
	<p>In line with  the goal of providing effective banking services to customers through all  channels, Ziraat Bank unwaveringly pressed ahead in its projects to provide an  effective service to customers in the Bank&rsquo;s branch and non-branch channels  with &ldquo;channel optimization&rdquo; activities.</p>
	<p>Within this  scope, the following activities were carried out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The  internet branch, which serves corporate customers, was renewed while the mobile  banking application was developed.</li>
		<li>The  Avans Bankkart (Advance Bankcard) feature was brought to Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s debit  cards. This feature allows payment delay for all shopping in Turkey, abroad and  online without charging any interest and without any workplace or amount  limits. As of December 2014, the Combo Kart, which is both credit and debit  card, was offered to the Bank&rsquo;s young customers.</li>
		<li>The  Quick Başakkart product was launched to provide Başak cards to customers more  rapidly.</li>
		<li>The  Retail Internet Banking application was updated and the range of transactions  was enhanced. The&nbsp;feature of confirming transactions without the need to  enter a password was enabled under the mobile banking application.</li>
		<li>Efforts  continued on adapting the mobile banking application to tablet devices and to  enhance the range of transactions available. Ziraat Mobile ATMs were also  launched in 2014.</li>
		<li>Marketing  and sales functions were separated. Accordingly, the Head Office and Regional  organizational structure were revised. Data analytics and monitor design  efforts continue for the branches in order to better understand customers and  provide appropriate services to them.</li>
		<li>With  The Barrier-Free Banking project, design activities in the branches and  non-branch channels were completed, improving disabled customers&rsquo; access to  financial services. Pilot activities continue in this area.</li>
		<li>Integration  activities for the Bank&rsquo;s and Ziraat Hayat Emeklilik&rsquo;s IT systems were  completed within the scope of Ziraat Finance Group&rsquo;s efforts to meet customers&rsquo;  financial needs through all of the Bank&rsquo;s financial partners.</li>
		<li>The  Board of Directors approved the Sustainability Policy which includes Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  sustainability vision, goals, approach and structuring as well as the Bank&rsquo;s  dialogue with its stakeholders and its stance on the environment, society and  its products and services. The&nbsp;sustainability report, which was the Bank&rsquo;s  first sustainability report, received a grade A+ by the GRI.</li>
		<li>Ziraat  Bank continued to establish more contact points for customers by expanding its  branch network in 2014. Within this scope, 53 new branches were opened in 2014,  with a total of 1,682 branches by the end of the year including 24 Corporate  branches, 80 Entrepreneurial branches, 90 Entrepreneurial Dynamic branches,  1,486 bank branches and 2 mobile branches.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>2. Corporate Business Processes: &ldquo;Correct  and fast credit evaluation, effective risk monitoring and efficient processes&rdquo;</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  continued its development activities for current credit evaluation modules  during 2014, with the purpose of improving credit evaluation ability and credit  processes with the aim of rapid loan allocation and correct analysis.  In&nbsp;line with Branch Banking strategy, the Small Enterprise Module was  added to credit evaluation modules and was put into practice in October.</p>
	<p>Credit  monitoring and follow-up systems were developed for the effective monitoring  and collection of credits. Within this scope, additional applications became  effective for customers who are under non-performing and close monitoring  classifications. In&nbsp;addition, development activities for report/warning  monitors were continued for monitoring collection and the delay status of the  loan portfolio.</p>
	<p>Integration  with the systems of corporations which have operations with Ziraat Bank is  another important issue. Within this scope, integration work with the General  Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre was completed, including customers&rsquo;  land registration information in the Bank&rsquo;s system. Integration with UYAP was  also completed, thus ensuring effective management of the Bank&rsquo;s legal  processes.</p>
	<p>As part of  the process management activities conducted to determine the Bank&rsquo;s processes  on an end to end basis and to detect areas for improvement, training for  process management methodology and software was transferred to the  process-owner business units and process modeling activities were conducted.  The&nbsp;&ldquo;Ziraat Finance Group Quality Policy&rdquo; will be based on the parameters  of providing continuous development, systematically measuring the performance  of the processes, carrying out process improvement activities in line with the  Bank&rsquo;s strategic priorities and budget targets, and providing the same quality  level of service not just for the Bank but also to its all partnerships.</p>
<h1>The aim of the transformation project is to bring the Ziraat Finance Group to the future in three main areas: Corporate Banking, Branch Banking and International Banking.</h1>
	<p><strong>3. Operational Excellence: &ldquo;Rapid  operations&rdquo;</strong></p>
	<p>In 2014,  Ziraat Bank continued its activities to transfer improvement and processes to  the center; these activities are carried out to ease the operational workload  on the branches, thus leaving the branches with time to concentrate on their  customers and create appropriate value propositions for customers by  appropriately determining their financial needs.</p>
	<p>A proportion  of the credit operations that had been carried in the branches and activities  within the scope of Arbitration Committee for Consumers defence and decision  papers were transferred to the head office.</p>
	<p>Work on a  system for the delivery of notices/warnings from the center approached  completion and the system will be active in the first quarter of 2015.  A&nbsp;pilot project for carrying out activities related to cancellation  letters for Mortgages and sequestrations from the center continues. This will be  made available for all branches in 2015.<br />
		Money  counting machines were renewed and the number of multi-functional printers was  increased with the purpose of speeding up operational processes in the  branches.</p>
	<p>The e-fax  project, which was initiated to record sent and received faxes and cut paper  waste, was completed and put into practice.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  continues to establish operational efficiency by providing automation in  activities carried out by the units in the branches, regions and headquarters  which will leave the operational labor force free to carry out customer  oriented operations. As a result of these activities between 2012 and 2014,  3,220 of the Bank&rsquo;s employees could instead focus on areas which can create  value-added.</p>
<div class="sola">
	<h4>customer focused</h4>
<h4>a bank which employees are proud to work in</h4>
</div>
	<p><strong>4. Objective and Transparent HR: &ldquo;A bank  which employees are proud to work in&rdquo;</strong></p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank  continued efforts to expand the scope of its performance management system,  including units at the head office. The&nbsp;system aims to enhance the  customer based business model, develop a marketing and effectiveness oriented  work approach, enhance employee loyalty by motivating them and rewarding  individual achievements in line with corporate goals.</p>
	<p>The Bank  maintains activities to develop its e-training and mobile training programs,  aimed at spreading information to a large audience, cheaply and quickly.  The&nbsp;method aims to ensure that employees have access to information at any  time.</p>
	<p>The  Management Trainee Program was initiated to fulfill the Bank&rsquo;s need for  managers. The&nbsp;managers of the future are trained through courses provided  within the scope of this program.</p>
	<p>An employee  suggestion system was launched in order to involve employees in the decision  making mechanism. Suggestions received through the employee suggestions system  have been evaluated by related units simultaneously and are put into practice.  Within this scope, 7,205 suggestions were transmitted to the system in 2014.  Required actions were taken for the approved suggestions.</p>
	<p>The  Competence Evaluation System was introduced in 2014 in order to integrate  employees&rsquo; competences in their performance score in addition evaluating their  goal-based performance. This system is planned to be brought into practice in  the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<div class="sola">
	<h4>right use of IT</h4>
<h4>quality balance sheet size</h4>
</div>
	<p><strong>5. Effective IT: &ldquo;Uninterrupted IT  services&rdquo;</strong><br />
IT infrastructure  and IT transformation activities, which started to effectively deploy  technology to conduct all operations without interruption and evaluate cost  advantages, continue. The&nbsp;Bank also started activities to renew the data  center in 2014.</p>
	<p>The basic  banking system screen infrastructure and document management system were  renewed and enabled to ensure more effective working. Ziraat Bank unwaveringly  continues to carry out activities for monitoring simplification and information  security.</p>
<p><strong>6. Sound Balance Sheet: &ldquo;Qualified  magnitude with a customer based balance</strong> <strong>sheet&rdquo;</strong><br />
The  principle of balance sheet management in line with shareholders&rsquo; equity was an  important guide in strategic decisions in 2014.</p>
<p>Within the  scope of activities to expand resource diversity, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s syndication  loan was renewed while the Bank continued to issue bills and bonds.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  issued its first Eurobond in 2014. The&nbsp;Bank secured USD&nbsp;750 million  from international capital markets for its Eurobond issue, with a 5 year maturity.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  completed a significant proportion of its work on the establishment of a  corporate expense management module in order to boost the effectiveness of  expense and inventory management, as well as for seeking cost advantages. This  module will enter effect in January 2015.</p>
