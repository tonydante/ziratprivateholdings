<p class="baslik">Risk Management Policies Adhered to According to Types of Risk</p>

<div id="midpanel">
	<p>Risk management activities at the Bank are conducted under the  Risk Management Guidelines approved by the Board of Directors decision no.  7-101, dated 21 March 2012. The fundamental approach to risk management is  to achieve the best possible practices in risk management functions by  inculcating a culture of risk-awareness throughout the Bank and by continuously  improving both the system and the Bank&rsquo;s human resources. </p>
	<p>Risk management activities cover the primary headings of credit  risk, market risk, operational risk, and balance sheet risks. Policy and  implementation principles concerning the management of these risks are carried  out in accordance with regulations on the basis of each type of risk, which are  approved by the Board of Directors. Maximum attention is given to ensuring that  the risk management activities that take place are conducted with the  coordinated participation of all units that are involved in every activity  associated with the risk categories. </p>
	<p>In addition, the Bank undertakes capital adequacy assessment  adopting the economic capital approach in order to determine the amount of  shareholders&rsquo; equity that is aligned with the losses it might sustain due to  its risk exposure, and the results are reported to the senior management.</p>
	<p class="kirmizi">Credit Risk</p>
	<p>Credit risk management involves manifesting the Bank&rsquo;s credit  	risk exposure, and defining, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting  	these risks.</p>
	<p>With the Basel II requirements published on 28 June 2012,  the parallel run carried out from 01 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 was  terminated, and legal reporting process was initiated from 01 July 2012.  Accordingly, the amount at credit risk that is calculated is reported to the  BRSA monthly on solo basis and quarterly on consolidated basis.</p>
	<p>The Bank established the Company Assessment Model so that  related units can determine the creditworthiness of customers in the  Commercial, Corporate and Entrepreneurial segments, and the Scoring Model for  establishing the creditworthiness of its customers in the Retail segment.  Validation is carried out to measure the accuracy and performance of these  models using statistical methods. In order to allow the use of advanced  measurement methods as well for calculating the amount at credit risk, work is  carried out on the results of the said scoring models.</p>
	<p>Credit risk limits, which are approved by the Board of  Directors, have been determined on the basis of customer segments; these limits  are monitored on a monthly basis and the risk-weighted assets that the Bank is  able to carry on the basis of segments are restricted with these limits.</p>
	<p>For tracking loan books and comparing their past performances,  monthly vintage analysis is conducted for housing, general-purpose, commercial,  agricultural and SME loans.</p>
	<p>Work is underway to conduct scenario analysis/stress testing for  the non-performing loan ratios.</p>
	<p class="kirmizi">Market Risk</p>
	<p>With a view to revealing the market risks that the Bank may be  	exposed to, risk measuring and monitoring are carried out, whose results are  	taken into consideration in the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making process.</p>
	<p>In market risk control, the market developments that affect the  current values of the portfolio at market risk, which is determined in line  with the Bank&rsquo;s trading strategy, are monitored at least on a daily basis, and  the impact of ordinary or extraordinary downward and upward moves in markets  upon the portfolio are analyzed.</p>
	<p>In order to be able to evaluate in advance the impact of adverse  developments that will take place in the parameters affecting the Bank&rsquo;s financial  strength on the activities and on market risks, stress tests and scenario  analyses are conducted.</p>
	<p>In an attempt to prevent the Bank&rsquo;s financial strength from  being significantly affected by increased volatility in the markets in the  performance of its day-to-day activities, signal values in the early warning  system are monitored and risk levels are restricted with limits.</p>
	<p>The amount at market risk to be included in the legal capital  adequacy ratio is calculated and reported using the standardized method.  Alignment with Basel II requirements has been achieved in calculations as  of July 2012. The market risk is measured on a daily basis using the  VaR-based internal method employed in addition to the standardized method,  which has been assessed and endorsed for fitness within the frame of  international best practices by an independent consultancy firm.</p>
	<p class="kirmizi">Operational Risk </p>
	<p>Our Bank assesses operational risks with respect to their  	origins (e.g. personnel, process, system and external), and manages them in  	accordance with the BRSA regulations.</p>
	<p>Operational risks that are realized across the Bank are  monitored through the Operational Risk Loss Database. Legal capital requirement  is calculated for operational risk using the basic indicator approach. Advanced  measurement methods are used within the frame of internal capital analyses and  economic capital is estimated for operational risk. </p>
	<p>Our Bank initiated work to set up the integrated risk mainframe  within the scope of COBIT. As of 2012, a database on Information Technology  risks was created, by which the risks realized and actions taken are monitored.</p>
	<p>Our Bank&rsquo;s Business Continuity Plan has been revised in line  with the Regulation on Banks&rsquo; Internal Systems published by the BRSA, and a  &ldquo;Business Impact Analysis&rdquo; was conducted which evaluated the probable risks  that may be caused by potential interruptions in operations and their potential  impacts.</p>
	<p>To ensure continuity of services obtained from companies to  which support services are outsourced, the Bank started assessing the risks  that might arise from service procurement within the scope of the Regulation on  the Outsourcing of Support Services by Banks published by the BRSA. In this  frame, the Risk Management Program has been prepared and enforced. Risk  analysis reports have been produced on the support services outsourced by our  Bank.</p>
	<p>An Operational Risk Map has been prepared for use in the  Internal Control audit program for the purpose of establishing the risk levels  of the Bank&rsquo;s branches.</p>
	<p class="kirmizi">Balance Sheet Risks </p>
	<p>To reveal the liquidity risk and the interest rate risks arising  	from banking accounts that the Bank may be exposed to, risk measuring and  	monitoring are carried out, whose results are taken into consideration in the  	Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making process. </p>
	<p>Liquidity risk control involves monitoring the maturity  mismatches between funds and placements; following-up cash and cash-equivalent  primary liquid reserve levels that will allow the Bank to pursue its normal  day-to-day activities as well as CBRT liquidity facilities that can be used for  fulfilling unexpected liquidity needs and secondary reserves that have the  potential to be liquidated with low price risk; monitoring borrowing facilities  from organized markets and thus, tracking free capital level. In addition,  scenario and sensitivity analyses are carried out in this frame.</p>
	<p>In interest rate risk control arising from banking accounts,  analyses and monitoring are carried out for ratio and maturity mismatches  between fixed and variable interest rate funds and placements; behavioral, as  well as contractual maturities of assets and liabilities, and the effects of  probable downward and upward, ordinary and extraordinary interest rate changes  on the interest rate and on the current value of assets and liabilities. Also,  Turkish lira and foreign currency interest margins created are watched closely.</p>
	<p>With a view to being able to evaluate in advance the impact of  adverse developments that will take place in the parameters affecting the  Bank&rsquo;s financial strength on the activities and balance sheet risks, stress  tests are conducted.</p>
	<p>In order to prevent our financial strength from being  significantly affected by increased volatility in the markets and potential  mismatches in cash inflows and outflows in the performance of our day-to-day  activities, signal values in the early warning system are monitored and risk  levels are restricted with limits.</p>
