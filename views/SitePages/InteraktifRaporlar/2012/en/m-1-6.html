<p class="solhilite"><strong>Attaining a solid and sustainable performance since its incorporation, Ziraat Bank rapidly progresses towards building the productive and efficient bank of the future on the back of the comprehensive change and transformation project that it has launched.</strong></p>
<p class="kirmizi">1863<br />
	Foundations of Ziraat Bank are laid...</p>
<p>In 1863,  Mithat Pasha, governor of Niş, a city in the former Yugoslavia that was Ottoman  territory at the time, led the establishment of the &ldquo;Homeland Coffers&rdquo; in the  town of Pirot by and under the auspices of the state. In 1867, the Homeland  Coffers Regulation was enacted and became the legal framework for the first  organized credit system in our country.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">1888<br />
	Ziraat Bank turns into a modern financial  institution…</p>
<p>In 1883, the  Homeland Coffers were replaced by Benefit Funds. In 1888, the governing statute  of Ziraat Bank went into force on 28&nbsp;August and the Bank&rsquo;s head office  began operations on 17&nbsp;September. As Benefit Funds were converted into  bank branches, a new era began in our organized agricultural loan history.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">1922<br />
	Ziraat Bank reunifies…</p>
<p>In 1919,  money was supplied from Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s funds to cover the expenses of  detachments of the Turkish National Army during the War of Independence and  used to purchase equipment for soldiers.</p>
<p>Upon the  establishment of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 23&nbsp;April 1920,  the management of all branches and funds in territories under the Parliament&rsquo;s  control was assigned to the Ankara Branch of the Ziraat Bank. Ankara took  control of İzmir operations on 09&nbsp;September 1922, followed by İstanbul  operations, and the Bank reunified on 23&nbsp;October 1922. </p>
<p>With the  establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, Ziraat Bank embarked upon a  period of rapid growth and extensive service delivery. The Bank began offering  service to the entire Turkish society with a particular focus on farmers all  over the country. Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s mission was no longer confined to the  agricultural sector. The Bank served as the engine of Turkey&rsquo;s growth process.</p>
<p class="kirmizi"> 1980s<br />
	Ziraat Bank turns into an institution of global  scale…</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  continued with its rapid growth. The Bank&rsquo;s New York and London representative  offices were turned into branches in 1983 and 1987 respectively, while  representative offices entered service in Duisburg, Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart,  and Rotterdam. Ziraat Bank was ranked 452nd in the Euromoney  magazine&rsquo;s 1988 list of the World&rsquo;s Top 500 Banks by Equity Capital.</p>
<p>During this  period, Ziraat Bank publicly opened Turkey&rsquo;s first banking museum in its head  office building in the Ulus district of Ankara and also launched the Banking  School. </p>
<p class="kirmizi">1990s<br />
	Ziraat Bank carries on with its international  expansion… </p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  Moscow, Kazkommerts Ziraat International Bank (KZI Bank), Turkmen Turkish  Commercial Bank (TTC Bank) and Uzbekistan Turkish Bank (UT Bank) began  operations in 1993.</p>
<p>In the same  year, Ziraat Bank ranked 202nd in Euromoney&rsquo;s top 500 banks, 41st  by net profit, and world first in return on equity.</p>
<p>The number  of the Bank&rsquo;s subsidiaries reached 21 in 1999.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">2000s<br />
	Ziraat Bank embarks upon a crucial era in its  history...</p>
<p>The Law 4603  passed in 2000 transformed Ziraat Bank into a joint-stock company. Within the  context of the restructuring of public banks, Ziraat Bank underwent extensive  changes starting in 2001. The Bank&rsquo;s organizational structure was completely  overhauled to bring it into line with the needs of modern banking and  international competition. In this process, Emlak Bank, another state-owned  bank, was merged into Ziraat Bank.</p>
<p>Having  successfully completed its mission, the Joint Administration Board of Public  Banks was disbanded in 2005.</p>
<p>With an  agreement signed by and between Ziraat Bank and Türkiye İş  credit union (İşbank),  Ziraat Bank credit cards acquired Maximum card properties in 2007.</p>
<p> Ziraat Bank  opened branches in Greece, Iraq and Saudi Arabia to reinforce its presence in  the Balkans and the Middle East, and increased the number of countries where it  operates to 16 as of year-end 2012.</p>
<p>In the  Turkey Customer Satisfaction Index released by the Quality Association of  Turkey (KalDer), Ziraat Bank was named the leader among public banks in customer  satisfaction in retail banking category from 2007 through 2010.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  posted the highest profit of all Turkish banks from 2004 through 2010.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Top  1000 World Banks&rdquo; listing published by The Banker magazine in 2011, Ziraat Bank  took the second place in Western Europe and the fifth place in the world in the  &ldquo;Best Profits on Average Capital&rdquo; category.</p>
<p>As a result  of the changes in office in 2011, Hüseyin Aydın was appointed as the Bank&rsquo;s  General Manager. In this period, the Bank launched the change and  transformation project under the slogan &ldquo;Together, to a Better Future&rdquo;, which  is aligned with the Bank&rsquo;s vision, mission and values and which took into  consideration the best practices in the industry.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Drawing closer to 150th year in service-Ziraat  Bank moves toward its targets of change and transformation… </p>
<p>Initial steps were taken to recreate Ziraat  Bank as a strong, competitive, leading bank that pioneers best banking  practices, is engaged in world-class banking and enjoys high market capitalization,  and significant way was paved towards the target of being &ldquo;more than a bank&rdquo;.</p>
