	<strong><strong>Ziraat Bank uninterruptedly carries on with its efforts in various fields with a special focus on education, sport, culture and the arts.</strong></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank extends increasing support to  sport.</strong><br />
As it has  done for the past three football seasons, Ziraat Bank sponsored the royalty of  the Turkish Football Cup for the fourth time in the 2012-2013 season. The  organization was renamed as the &ldquo;Ziraat Turkish Cup&rdquo;.</p>
<p>During the  2012/2013 season, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s sponsorship of the sport club that successfully  represents the Bank in the Aroma Men&rsquo;s Premiere Volleyball League since the  2007/2008 season continued.</p>
<p><strong>Support to the arts is an essential tradition  for Ziraat Bank.</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank  has attached utmost importance to the arts and artists ever since its  incorporation, which is underlined by the slogan &ldquo;In Art For Art&rdquo;. The Bank added  new links to the chain of support given to the arts since the 1990s, and opened  the Mithatpaşa, Kuğulu, Tünel and Kızıltan Ulukavak art galleries and the Ömer  Nafi Güvenli Exhibition Hall for art-lovers. </p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  continued to support activities in various artistic disciplines in 2012 as it  has been doing every year, and sponsored 50 exhibitions that were mounted on  Ankara Kuğulu and Mithatpaşa Art Galleries in Ankara and Tünel Art Gallery in  İstanbul in the 2011/2012 season. The exhibitions were visited by more than  40,000 art enthusiasts.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank is the founder of Turkey&rsquo;s first  Banking Museum.</strong><br />
	The Ziraat  Bank Museum, housed in the Ceremonial Hall of the Bank&rsquo;s Original Head Office  building in Ankara&rsquo;s Ulus district was opened on 20&nbsp;November 1981. The  museum puts on display the 149-year long deep-rooted history of the Bank that  has borne witness to almost every phase of the Republic era, and is the first  museum devoted to banking in Turkey. </p>
<p>The Ziraat  Bank Museum offers a view of the commercial, economic, political, cultural,  artistic and educational transformations that the Turkish banking industry has  undergone since its beginning right up to the present day. On display in this  historic setting are numerous antique objects that reflect these  characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising and publicity activities</strong><br />
	During 2012,  three films were aired on the visual media that were sequels to the one  preceding each, which were made for advertising and publicity purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Other activities</strong><br />
	Having  sponsored many trade shows held in and out of Turkey during 2012, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  support contributed to the launch of projects that are important for our  country.</p>
