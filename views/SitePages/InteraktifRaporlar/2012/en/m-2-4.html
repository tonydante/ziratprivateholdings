<div id="midpanel">
	<p><span class="kirmizi" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Activities in 2012</span> </p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Within the frame of operating principles built on sustainable  profitability, productivity and customer-focus, our Bank recognizes that the  human resource is the key element that makes a difference in competition, and  continued to implement and further build on the modern human resources  management system it has adopted in line with the principles of transparency  and compliance with banking ethics.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Aiming to fulfill the requirements of banking and international  competition and to provide modern and reliable banking service, Ziraat Bank had  23,153 employees on its payroll at the end of 2012. 82% of the employee body  holds undergraduate and graduate degrees; average age of employees is 38 and  average tenure is 14 years.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Offering young people the chance to advance in their banking  careers through its transparent approach to career management, our Bank  continued to open its doors to numerous new graduates in 2012 following suit of  previous years. A test was given for employing 3,265 people in different  positions. The recruitment test and announcements asked the candidates to  specify their preferred city for working in, in line with the principle of  hiring locally.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Our Bank espoused a clearly defined career management concept.  Within the scope of this concept, our Bank aims to fill managerial positions  through promotion from within and gives the young people the chance to advance  in their banking careers.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Under the promotions made in 2012, 1,860 employees successfully  passed the promotion tests, whereas 412 employees succeeded in the  qualification/interview system and were entitled to advance to the higher  position.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Major innovations were made also in the human resources  practices within the scope of the Bank Customer Service Model concept  formulated upon the principles of customer-focus, rapid service delivery, and  efficient communication. </span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In line with the customer segmentation the Bank carried out,  &ldquo;job position&rdquo; implementation was introduced in career management. In addition  to the title designation that indicates the professional level of employees, a  &ldquo;job position&rdquo; is determined for each employee in accordance with the job  performed, the customer segment addressed, and the distinction between  marketing versus operations functions.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">As at year-end 2012, 857 branches switched to the new business  model and 16,976 employees have been appointed to their new job positions.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">For branch employees who switched/will switch to their new job  positions, certification training programs were organized covering all the  skills and knowledge required by the relevant position of each employee, in  addition to the Bank Customer Service Model training sessions.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">During 2012, a total of 1,926 programs were given to 17,229  employees and average training time per person was 23 hours. In addition, 27  e-learning programs were made available to Bank employees within the frame of  distant learning, from which 16,025 employees benefited.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In the reporting period, the Bank provided internship to 1,022  vocational high school students and 2,060 university students, thereby  contributing to vocational training and also enhancing brand awareness as an  &ldquo;employer&rdquo;.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">As of year-end, the Bank moved to the new remuneration system  based on the titles and job positions of employees.</span>	</p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Our Bank implements Branch Performance System; according to the  results of this system, Performance Bonuses are paid as a separate element  apart from the salaries and compensations paid on the basis of salary  determination principles. In this framework, employees are paid performance  bonuses at quarterly intervals in February, May, August and November.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Performance Bonuses are distributed to employees under the name  &ldquo;General Performance Bonus&rdquo; and do not exceed 7% of an employee&rsquo;s total monthly  salary. &ldquo;General Performance Bonus&rdquo; payments are determined according to branch  rankings based on scales announced quarterly. Ranked among their peers in each  scale, branches are divided into six Performance Groups according to percentage  tranches; while each Performance Group receives payments calculated using  different coefficients, the branches that fall under the final 6th  group do not qualify for the General Performance Bonus payment.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">On the other hand, employees of regional offices receive  performance bonus payments based on the average General Performance Bonus  coefficients of affiliated branches, whereas head office employees are paid  performance bonuses on the basis of the average General Performance Bonus  coefficients of regional offices. Employees who have left the Bank or are on  unpaid leave receive the performance bonus amount that they have become  entitled to for the period of time they have actively worked. However,  employees who have been given disciplinary punishment may not benefit from the  performance bonus payments for the period of time determined depending on the  punishment given.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In 2013, Individual Performance System will be introduced at our  Bank.</span></p>
	<p><span class="kirmizi" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">2013 Projections</span> </p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In 2013, our Bank will continue to provide its employees with  constant training, career opportunities aligned with their respective job  positions, and modern working conditions.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Within the frame of the efforts to switch to the Bank Customer  Service Model, the transition of all employees to new job positions will be  completed.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Certification training will continue for employees who have  already switched to their job positions, and orientation training will be  organized for a total of 3,265 newcomers to the Bank.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Having become a trademark in the banking industry since its  inception in 1989, the &ldquo;School of Banking&rdquo;, which educates qualified staff for  the entire banking and financial services sector, and represents a first in  Turkey as a comprehensive training program that offers various information in a  single package needed by banking professionals, will be vested in even higher  quality in 2013 thanks to the collaboration with a university. In the year  ahead, the program will keep training and cultivating the prospective managers  who will drive our Bank to its goals in line with its vision and strategies.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The Bank will make continued use of advancing technology in all  of its human resources practices and training systems, and new systems will be  introduced in training management and e-learning programs.</span></p>
