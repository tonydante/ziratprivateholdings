<p><strong>ZİRAAT SİGORTA A.Ş.</strong></p>
<p>Founded on  11&nbsp;May 2009, and having started its insurance operations in 2010, Ziraat  Sigorta achieved all of its targets in 2012. The premiums that amounted to  TL&nbsp;378,763,559 at the end of the year represent a year-on rise by 19%,  which outdid the average premium rise of 17% attained by the overall non-life  insurance industry in the same period. The company had 2.33% market share in  2012. Ziraat Sigorta remained the company with the highest RoE percentage in  the sector in 2012, when it also increased its production. Succeeding in  attaining sustainable growth and profitability since the first year it was  founded, Ziraat Sigorta has become an exemplary company in the sector.</p>
<p>Agriculture  insurance made up the key production branch for Ziraat Sigorta in 2012, in  which the company sustained its leadership in premium production in the sector.  Commanding 50% share in the company&rsquo;s portfolio for the past two years, this  branch is anticipated to maintain the same weight in the years coming. Thanks  to the alternative sales channels that are planned to be introduced in 2013, a  remarkable growth is expected in personal accident and unemployment insurance  products, as well as in the sales of Compulsory Earthquake Insurance (in  Turkish: DASK) policies that represent a significant production item. </p>
<p>Ever since  its inception, Ziraat Sigorta has analyzed the data demand structure in the  insurance market and has been active in profit-yielding branches rather than in  those that produce losses. The composition of the company&rsquo;s customer portfolio  and its geographic distribution are of a nature that allows sustainable  profitability and growth. Ever since its incorporation, the company has been  developing innovative products so as to increase penetration in this area where  it already possesses superiority, and has been striving to create additional  capacities and to enlarge the existing pie. In addition, Ziraat Sigorta targets  at a portfolio composition with a focus on profitability, and creates  underwriting and pricing policies that are aligned with the insurance  technique.</p>
<p>Having  become a role model that is closely watched in the sector owing to its  successful bancassurance activities, Ziraat Sigorta remained the highest  premium generator in this field in 2012. It is aimed to carry the company up  the rankings on the back of incentive implementations that will be launched so  as to gain greater access to the Bank&rsquo;s insurance potential and increased  contribution of other distribution channels to premium production.</p>
<p><strong>ZİRAAT HAYAT VE EMEKLİLİK A.Ş. </strong></p>
<p>Ziraat Hayat  ve Emeklilik A.Ş. received permission for incorporation on 11&nbsp;May 2009 and  entered operation in the life insurance and personal accident insurance  branches at the beginning of 2010. Involved in the Private Pension System since  July 2011, the company continued with its rapid ascent during 2012.</p>
<p>Based on the  year-end premium production data published by the Association of the Insurance  and Reinsurance Companies of Turkey (TSRŞB), the company was the sector&rsquo;s  leader in the life branch with premium production of TL&nbsp;806 million,  corresponding to a market share of 30% in 2011. The company maintained its  leading position throughout 2012.</p>
<p>In view of  the end-December 2012 data released by the Insurance Association of Turkey,  Ziraat Hayat ve Emeklilik attained a premium production of TL&nbsp;590.3  million in life and personal accident branches that corresponded to a market  share of 20.72%, and closed 2012 as the sector&rsquo;s leader, as it did in the  previous years. The company paid approximately TL&nbsp;403 million in  compensation to its insured customers for 46,824 claims in 2012.</p>
<p>The total  assets of Ziraat Hayat ve Emeklilik A.Ş., including pension mutual funds, rose  from TL&nbsp;900 million (TL&nbsp;848 million excluding pension mutual funds)  at the end of 2011 to TL&nbsp;1,131 million including pension mutual funds  (TL&nbsp;962 million excluding pension mutual funds) by the end of 2012,  corresponding to a year-on increase of approximately 26%. In addition, the  company&rsquo;s average RoE was 56% at end-December 2012.</p>
<p>Ziraat Hayat  ve Emeklilik began its operations in the Private Pension System in July 2011,  which has been developing rapidly in the recent years both in terms of  legislation and social awareness. The company&rsquo;s pension mutual funds in the  system rose from TL&nbsp;51.7 million to TL&nbsp;169.7 million in the twelve  months to end-2012.</p>
<p>Besides the  amendments made to the law and regulations that regulate the Private Pension  System, a new regulation was published and went into force on 01&nbsp;January  2013, which introduced the &ldquo;State Subsidy&rdquo; concept. The expected growth that  resulted in the private pension sector owing to these new requirements was  considered also by the company, which forecasts that the amount of pension  mutual funds will top TL&nbsp;400 million by the end of 2013.</p>
<p>The company  spent various efforts in an effort to vest its sales organization in a dynamic  structure in parallel with the developments in the sector during 2012. Training  programs were organized for preparing the Bank employees for the licensing  exams given by the Pension Monitoring Center, so as to enable them to serve as  Private Pension Intermediaries. Achieving a success rate of 95% at the exam,  129 employees earned the title Private Pension Intermediary.</p>
<p>As a result,  the performance to be displayed by the Bank&rsquo;s employees along with the  company&rsquo;s existing sales force under the &ldquo;Ziraat Finance Group&rdquo; roof will form  the basis of the high amounts of pension mutual funds the company aspires to  achieve.</p>
<p>Ziraat Hayat  ve Emeklilik offers service to its customers through private pension plans and  life insurance products. <br />
	Addressing a  broad customer segment, the company&rsquo;s primary private pension plans include,  among others, &ldquo;Güldüren Yarınlar Planı&rdquo; (planning for a future that will make  you smile) &ldquo;Bereket Planı&rdquo; (Plan for Plenty) designed for interest-rate  sensitive customers, &ldquo;Şemsiye Planı&rdquo; (Umbrella Plan) that provides special  advantages to newcomers who enter the System with their savings, and other  plans that offer special advantages for various professions and that are  utilized during campaign periods.</p>
<p>In addition  to Group Life and Group Personal Accident Insurance products designed for  groups, Ziraat Hayat ve Emeklilik offers corporate solutions through Personal  Private Pension Linked to Group or Employer Group Pension plans that are also  targeted towards groups.</p>
<p>On the life  insurance front, major products include &ldquo;Hayata Dair Yıllık Hayat Sigortası&rdquo;  (Annual Life Insurance for Life) that pays an indemnity not only in the event  of death or disability but also in the event of contracting one of the 12  dangerous illnesses that include cancer, stroke, heart disease, etc., and  &ldquo;Hayat Arkadaşım Yıllık Hayat Sigortası&rdquo; (Annual Life Insurance for my Spouse)  which offers various optional assurances in addition to death coverage.</p>
<p>In an effort  to provide assurance for diverse risks against which its customers need  protection, Ziraat Hayat ve Emeklilik continues to work on new and customized  products such as education insurance, long-term life insurance, credit card  protection, income protection and pension income plan. These products are  planned to be introduced in the second half of 2013, depending also on the  system infrastructure.</p>
