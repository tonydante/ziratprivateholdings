<p class="baslik">Audit Committee's Assessment of the Operation of the Internal Audit, Internal Control, and Risk Management Systems</p>

<div id="midpanel">
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The internal audit, internal control and risk management  activities at Ziraat Bank are carried out by the Board of Auditors and Internal  Control and Risk Management Group, which have segregated duties and  responsibilities, are organizationally independent from each other, but work in  coordination.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Set up to cover all units, branches and the Bank&rsquo;s subsidiaries  subject to audit, the organization aims to ensure complete and secure pursuance  of banking activities, realization of long-term profit targets, reliable  financial and administrative reporting, and minimization of unexpected risks  that might negatively affect the Bank&rsquo;s reputation and financial stability.</span></p>
	<p><span class="kirmizi" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL AUDIT SYSTEM</span> </p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The Board of Auditors adopts a risk-focused approach to auditing  and controls compliance of the activities carried out by all of the Bank&rsquo;s head  office units, domestic and international branches, and subsidiaries under its  control with the law and other applicable legislation, as well as the Bank&rsquo;s  internal strategy, policy, principles and targets, including internal control  and risk management. The Board of Auditors keeps the Bank&rsquo;s Senior Management  informed and pursues its efforts in a manner to contribute to the  decision-making processes of the Senior Management.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Having 174 members and working in line with the international  internal audit standards, the Board of Auditors, during 2012, audited and  evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of transaction steps that make up  the primary processes, and the secondary processes, besides auditing the  compliance of the Bank&rsquo;s activities with the processes that they are governed  by. In addition, the Bank&rsquo;s IT Inspectors audited the processes identified in  the Regulation on Bank Information Systems and Banking Processes published by  the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) in line with the Bank&rsquo;s  implementations.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Apart from on-site audits that are conducted using the reporting  structure integrated into the Bank&rsquo;s system, the Centralized Audit Team, which  operates under the Board of Auditors and produces a dissuasive effect in terms  of establishing actual irregularities and of preventing possible irregularities  with the scenario analyses implemented, continues to increase its contributions  to the activities of the Board of Auditors owing to these characteristics.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">During the audits carried out, inspectors continued to make  determinations and give recommendations, which are designed to give an  introduction to regionally important sectors, and to ensure rapid  decision-making regarding existing and/or potential risks and opportunities  involving the loan book, in particular.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In addition, the members of the Board of Auditors strived to  build up the personnel&rsquo;s practical knowledge through on-site trainings given in  branches in 2012. On the other hand, the inspectors have the opportunity to  conduct audit in different units periodically and thereby to constantly build  on their professional knowledge and experience; they were also given training  at certain intervals to support their personal and professional development.  Along the line, the Bank continued in 2012 to implement the training catalogue,  which is formulated by identifying the training programs for each member of the  Board of Auditors in any seniority, and opportunities were created for the  members of the Board of Auditors to take part in numerous extramural meetings,  conferences and workshops during the reporting period.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Having made it a principle and a goal to make significant  contributions to the Bank&rsquo;s qualified and high-quality human resource, the  Board of Auditors provided an intensive transition of its members to  administrative duties during 2012; hence, the Bank&rsquo;s experienced members who  have been involved in the examination and inspection of the Bank&rsquo;s various  domestic and international branches, regional offices and Head Office units  continued to offer administrative service to our Bank&rsquo;s different units in  various geographies. On the other hand, the recruitment process has been  completed for assistant inspectors, who will begin working by early 2013  according to the plans.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The Board of Inspectors continues to evaluate the organizational  changes at the Bank, the modules introduced in lending decisions and the  systematic differences arising from the launch of centralized allocation  structures, and Operations Center, and keeps working on the planned changes  regarding the audit system.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In the period ahead, the Board of Auditors will continue to be  guided by a high sense of responsibility and duty in the execution of the internal  audit plan to be devised in line with the targets and policies determined by  the Bank&rsquo;s Senior Management and within the frame of the modern approach to  audit; in the reporting of their outcomes to the Board of Directors via the  Audit Committee, and in monitoring the precautions to be adopted based on audit  reports.</span></p>
	<p><span class="kirmizi" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP</span></p>
	<p><span class="kirmizi" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Internal control activities are organized so as to cover the  activities of the Bank&rsquo;s domestic and international branches, regional branches  and head office units under the Regulation on Banks&rsquo; Internal Systems issued by  the BRSA, and are constantly revised in line with the Bank&rsquo;s requirements.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Control programs for branches are devised quarterly within the  frame of the branches&rsquo; risk map prepared by the risk management department.  They take into consideration 135 different criteria including, among others,  branch scales, transaction volumes, changes in the amount of lending and  results of the previous control period, as well as the control schedule of the  Board of Inspectors. These programs are enforced upon approval of our  Committee. Controls are carried out on an average of 950 branches in every  quarter within the scope of the program.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The control intervals of head office units are determined in  view of the units&rsquo; functions and risk exposure, their job descriptions and  impact on the Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet, and are revised in line with the needs.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Pursuant to the provision under Article 9/3 of the Regulation on  the Bank&rsquo;s Internal Systems that reads &ldquo;Internal control system is organized to  cover the bank&rsquo;s domestic and international branches, head office units,  consolidated partnerships and all of its activities&rdquo;, internal control activity  at all of our branches abroad are conducted in accordance with the annual  control plans that are approved by our Committee.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Findings contained in the reports resulting from the control  activities conducted are categorized under certain headings, and are shared  with relevant units and the Senior Management.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">As a result of the switch to the new service model at the Bank,  introduction of centralized allocation structure in retail loans and of new  modules in other types of loans, and centralization of operations, manual  transactions have been substantially migrated to the system, and work is  ongoing for integrating the transactions that are still performed manually to  the system. Given that centralized controls will increase along with the  systematic controls introduced under these implementations, the operational  workloads of Internal Controllers assigned to the field are expected to be  alleviated.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">On-site Internal Controllers continued in 2012 to conduct  examinations regarding matters established during the control activities and  deemed to require further examination. Necessary action to be taken by the Bank  based on the preliminary examination reports so issued were put into life  forthwith and transactions doubted to be subject to abuse were shared with the  Board of Auditors for ensuring that necessary examinations/investigations are  undertaken.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In addition to the above, compliance control activities are also  carried out by the internal control function within the frame of Article 18 of  the Regulation on the Banks&rsquo; Internal Systems. In this frame, all of the past  and planned activities of the Bank, as well as new products and transactions  are controlled in terms of their compliance with the Law and other applicable  legislation, internal policies and guidelines, and established banking practices.  Furthermore, legislation issued or modified by the Bank is also reviewed within  the scope of compliance controls and resulting opinions are shared with the  related units.</span>	</p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Besides control activities, recommendation reports continued to  be issued, which are aimed at improving the processes related to the activities  carried out at the Bank by Internal Controllers and at prevention of possible  risks. The objectives of this implementation are to prevent risks by  identifying them in advance, improving processes so as to achieve alignment  with the competitive environment and customer satisfaction, and taking  cost-saving measures.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Besides the activities mentioned above that can be considered as  basic duties, Internal Controllers are encouraged to take on administrative  duties; along this line, 37 Internal Controllers were transferred to  administrative positions during 2012, thus continuing to supply qualified human  resource to the Bank&rsquo;s administrative personnel. In addition, it was decided to  hire 36 assistant internal controllers from outside the Bank to be trained to  replace the internal controllers who have been transferred to administrative  duties, and to sustain the dynamic nature of the internal controller staff.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In brief, internal control activities are being carried out in  harmony with the Bank&rsquo;s primary targets and strategies with respect to scope  and implemented method. However, a proactive structure has been adopted to  ensure immediate alignment with the changed strategy and conditions upon the altered  risk perception and transition to the new service model. This proactive  structure contributed to the execution of the Bank&rsquo;s activities at a level  above the industrial norms and in alignment with internal and external  regulations, as well as competitive conditions.</span></p>
	<p><span class="kirmizi" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">OPERATION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</span> </p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The fundamental approach to risk management activities carried  out at the Bank is to achieve the best possible practices in risk management  functions by inculcating a culture of risk-awareness throughout the Bank and by  continuously improving both the system and the human resources. Maximum  attention is given to ensuring that the risk management activities that take  place are conducted with the coordinated participation of all units that are  involved in every activity associated with each category of risk.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Risk management activities cover the main headings of credit  risk, market risk, operational risk and balance sheet risks (interest rate risk  arising from banking accounts and liquidity risk), and have the ultimate  objective of achieving compliance with international best practices.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Under credit risk management activities, work is undertaken for  defining, measuring, monitoring and reporting credit risk, employing methods  that are in alignment with Basel II. In this context, legal reporting process  started using the Basel II Standardized Method as of 01 July 2012. The  amount at credit risk is reported to the BRSA monthly on a solo basis, and  quarterly on a consolidated basis. Efforts are ongoing at the Bank for  measuring creditworthiness in connection with advanced measurement methods. In  this frame, work is being carried out on the outcomes of scoring models used  for different loan portfolios. Validation is carried out using statistical  methods to measure the accuracy and performance of these scoring models.  Furthermore, credit risk limits that are approved by the Board of Directors are  monitored, and work is in progress to conduct scenario analyses and stress  testing for the non-performing loans ratio.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Under the operational risk management activities, operational  risks are defined, classified, measured and analyzed. Operational risk loss  database in Finart environment allows tracking incidents of operational risk.  Risks arising from information technology and actions taken are followed up. An  Operational Risk Map is being prepared for use in the Internal Control audit  program for the purpose of establishing the risk levels of the Bank&rsquo;s branches.  In addition, risk exposure assessments are conducted for companies providing  outsourced support services within the frame of the BRSA&rsquo;s regulations in  force.</span>	</p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Within the scope of market and balance sheet risk management  activities, market risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk arising from  banking accounts are measured, analyzed, limited, reported and monitored, and  the analyses made are supported with stress tests.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">For determining the shareholders&rsquo; equity amount that is aligned  with the loss our Bank might sustain due to its risk exposure, capital adequacy  assessment is made using the economic capital approach and the results are  reported to the senior management.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Results of the analyses made under risk management activities  and risk indicators are reported to the Board of Directors and our Committee at  six-month intervals, and to executive units and internal system units at  monthly, weekly and daily intervals. </span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The new operating period will see continued activities under all  risk categories on the basis of internationally accepted advanced risk  management techniques, as well as execution of these activities as an integral  part of the Bank&rsquo;s strategic decision-making processes.</span></p>
