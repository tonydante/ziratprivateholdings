	<p class="solhilite"><strong>For Turkey, 2012 was a year of preparing the suitable ground for a soft landing process with the target of healthy and sustainable growth.</strong></p>
<p class="kirmizi">Outlook of the Global Economy</p>
<p><strong>In 2012, the risks against the global economic  recovery gradually lessened, but the issues were yet to achieve a sustainable  solution trend. </strong><br />
	<br />
	While the  developments relating to the Eurozone have been telling on the global economy,  rates of growth generally declined in developed and emerging countries, and  high volatilities were observed in the global risk appetite.</p>
<p>The  highlights of 2012 included the unemployment and the fiscal cliff in the USA,  the banking sector, growth, employment and trust issues in the Eurozone, the  new government that took to the power in Japan which gives the foreground to  growth and to monetary expansion in the same direction, and the monetary  expansion policies maintained by other developed countries.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/InteraktifRaporlar/2012/images/en4.png" alt="" width="168" height="502" /></p>
<p>Despite the  relatively positive growth rates attained in the US economy, the US Fed was  forced to launch a third round of quantitative easing in 2012 due to the  housing and especially employment markets that failed to capture the desired  levels. While the US Fed expressed a deadline for this decision at the start,  it pegged the easing policy to unemployment and inflation levels by a  subsequent decision. The so-called &ldquo;fiscal cliff&rdquo; issue, which stipulates the  elimination of tax advantages provided in previous periods and reduction of  public spending, caused the risks to come to the forefront in the last quarter  of the year on the part of USA, and bore a relatively negative impact upon  global markets. With the solution of the fiscal cliff by postponing it at the  onset of 2013, the concerns about this issue have been put off at least until  mid-2013.</p>
<p>Apparently,  central banks of developed countries continued to loosen their monetary  policies in 2012 in conjunction with the outlook of global growth. The European  Central Bank (ECB) announced a short-term bonds buying program for countries  suffering from debt issues, in addition to monetary expansion programs, and  strove to prevent the high levels of borrowing interests in Spanish and Italian  economies. The ECB&rsquo;s efforts to protect the euro and to keep the banking  industry on its feet have been influential in alleviated concerns regarding the  region. Hence, in parallel with the concrete steps taken towards resolving the  issues in the Eurozone, the concerns hovering over this geography relatively  lessened at the end of the year. However, it is still early to suggest that  things are moving along a definitive solution path. It is another determination  that the debt and growth issues are changing the political visage of Europe.</p>
<p>One of the  countries that turned to monetary expansion in the last quarter of 2012, Japan  upped its inflation target to 2% and announced that it will purchase certain  amounts of assets every month starting from 2014 without quoting a deadline.  The loose monetary and exchange rate policy that the new government will pursue  led to rearticulation of the currency wars. As such, the Bank of Japan, Japan&rsquo;s  central bank, has been the first central bank to target a higher inflation  level than the most recent one.</p>
<p>The downward  trend in the growth rate of China, the greatest contributor to the growth of  emerging economies, persisted throughout 2012. Having completed 2012 with a  growth rate of 7.8%, China entered into a recovery trend toward the end of the  year, which brings about an anticipated high rate of growth, although below the  average trend, in the year ahead. Based on the most recent data, China seems to  have qualified as the world&rsquo;s biggest economy. Characterized as the country  whose economic and financial activities are most closely monitored among the  BRICS countries and one who significantly affects the global financial  architecture, China is named among the most important countries.</p>
<p>While the  short-term capital flows to emerging economies gained speed in parallel with  the risk appetite that increased in conjunction with the continued global  monetary expansion in 2012, it has followed a fluctuating course. Emerging  economies were also confronted with declining growth, and risks over inflation  and exchange rates gained the foreground.</p>
<p>According to  IMF predictions, the GDP growth in the world that was estimated to be 3.2% in  2012 is anticipated to increase moderately to 3.5% in 2013. However, it is  believed that the emerging economies will grow faster as they did during the  crisis period, attaining 5.5% growth in 2013, and thus steer the worldwide  growth.</p>
<p>The IMF  forecasts 1.4% GDP growth in developed economies in 2013. This anticipation  hints at some improvement in economic activities this year, and the start of  positive progress towards solution of issues, even if they will remain to be  solved. However, in 2013, all countries will be looking at a year when the  issues related to the real economy will continue in many countries, the element  of trust in the markets is yet to be rebuilt, and problems in relation to  employment and investments will sustain. It is a wish shared by all that the  rebalancing, the indications of which were started to be observed in 2012, will  continue and further increase during 2013.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>2013 is expected to see some improvement in the  economic activities of developed countries and the start of positive progress  even if solution of issues will remain elusive.</strong></p>
<p class="kirmizi">Outlook for the Turkish Economy</p>
<p><strong>For Turkey who exhibited a relatively higher  performance amid the global crisis, 2012 was a year of preparing the suitable  ground for a soft landing process with the target of healthy and sustainable  growth.</strong></p>
<p>The economic  rebalancing process became more pronounced, the inflation adopted a downturn,  the current account balance showed improvement that went on throughout the  year, and its ratio to GDP declined to nearly 6.5%. The rapid growth momentum  of 8.5% captured in 2011 lost pace as a result of the measures adopted and 2.2%  growth was attained in 2012. Economic activity continued to decelerate  throughout 2012 and while the contribution of the domestic demand to growth  diminished, the contribution of net foreign demand turned to positive, and the  growth composition acquired a healthier outlook. The foreign demand was  restrained by the weak growth in conjunction with the sustained issues in the  Eurozone, and the share of export to European countries decreased. However,  African and Middle Eastern countries secured constantly rising shares in  Turkey’s exports as a result of our increased share in alternative markets in  the past period, and exports to these countries performed positively, as a  result of which net exports proved to be a major contributor to annual growth.</p>
<p class="solhilite"><strong>The inflation adopted a downturn, the current account balance showed improvement that went on throughout the year.</strong></p>

<p>The loss of  pace in the rate of increase in tax revenues in connection with the decelerated  economic activity and the accelerated non-interest expenses have led to a  relative weakening in the budget performance, and the ratio of budget deficit  to the GDP was near 2.3%, which is the Medium Term Program target.</p>
<p>After  registering 10.45% in the previous year due to the depreciated Turkish lira,  tax adjustments, and the rising food prices, the inflation declined to its  lowest year-end value since 2005 at 6.16%, as a result of the positive course  of unprocessed food prices, the policies implemented, and the elimination of  the base effect of the previous year in 2012.</p>
<p>While there  was an increase in the overall risk appetite as a result of the monetary  expansion policy implementations by the central banks of developed countries  particularly from the third quarter of 2012, the short-term capital flows to  emerging countries showed a reviving trend and the risk premiums of emerging  economies declined in parallel with the rising global risk appetite. Turkey  also got her share of short-term capital flows as a result of the macroeconomic  indicators data and particularly current deficit data that turned out to be  more positive than what was anticipated and the upgrade of Turkey’s long-term  credit rating to investment grade by Fitch Ratings in November.</p>
<p>As growing  capital flows increased the tendency of emerging countries to turn to  alternative measures apart from customary policies, they have reestablished the  importance of possessing a loose policy framework. In this frame, the Central  Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) developed additional tools that support  financial stability with the policy mix it has been implementing since  end-2010. In the timeframe from the last quarter of 2011 until the middle of  2012, monetary tightening was implemented at certain intervals due to the  fluctuating risk appetite and the risks over the outlook of inflation. From  June 2012, the liquidity supplied to the market was increased to gradually  decrease funding costs because of the improved global risk appetite, the  strengthened economic rebalancing, and the downward trend of inflation, and a  more supportive stance was adopted progressively starting from the middle of  2012. In a period when inflation also took a downturn owing to its  multi-purpose and multi-tool policies, the CBRT played an active part in the  markets proactively using tools such as the interest rate corridor, required  reserves, and reserve option mechanism, while observing the financial stability  along with the price stability.</p>
<p>For our  country, 2013 is expected to be a more positive year than 2012 with respect to  growth, inflation and current deficit trends. In this framework, it is expected  that 2013 will be a year when all economy authorities will be striving to move  to a stable and sustainable growth that is backed by the monetary policy,  focused on domestic demand provided that it is moderate and keeps an eye on the  inflation trend, as well as on exports. In the year ahead, global developments,  commodity prices and geopolitical risks will continue to affect the macro  framework and policies. </p>
<p> Based on the  prediction that the overall levels of interest rates will remain low, low-cost  financing facilities secured from abroad are expected to continue. Most  certainly, the multi-tool and multi-purpose monetary policy that sticks to a  cautious stance and the relentless adherence to budget performance will also be  persisted. Along these lines, it is wished that 2013 will be a year of  continued positive decoupling recently captured among world economies, and of  economic transformation where the wins are protected in the medium term and  stability is captured.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Developments in the Banking Sector</p>
<p><strong>Despite the ongoing uncertainties inflicting  the global economy that is in the process of seeking stability, increased  regulatory requirements and intensive competitive environment, the Turkish  banking sector recorded a stable growth.</strong><br />
	<br />
	Against the  backdrop of a global economy that is undergoing a rough time since 2008 that  marked the onset of the global economic crisis, the Turkish banking industry  played a key role in the preserved solid structure of the Turkish economy with  its robust capital structure, asset quality and profitability. By transferring  funds to the economy, the Turkish banking sector was highly influential in the  acceleration of economic activities and our country’s rapid growth in the aftermath  of the global economic crisis.</p>
<p><strong>2012 has been a year of controlled expansion  for the credit volume of the national banking sector in parallel with the  overall economy so as to ensure sustainable growth.</strong></p>
<p>The  increased funding costs within the frame of measures adopted to achieve  financial stability in the first half of 2012 put the brakes on the growth of  the banking industry. From the second half of 2012, however, the growth  regained speed owing to the CBRT’s approach aimed at increasing the liquidity  in the markets and reducing funding costs, in line with the positive  developments in the current deficit and economy.</p>
<p>The rising  profit of the industry in 2012 was driven by the non-interest income that  increased as a result of higher gains on exchange differences, fees,  commissions and banking service revenues, and the growing net interest margin.  On the other hand, there was some rise in the ratio of non-performing loans to  total lending. </p>
<p>The asset  structure of the banking sector represents a striking change. According to the  data released by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), the  share of loans to total assets went up from 44.9% in 2006 to 58.5% at the end  of 2012.</p>
<p><strong>In 2013...</strong><br />
	In the year  ahead, the Turkish banking sector is anticipated to display a growth that is  parallel to the economic growth on the back of its robust capital structure and  asset quality, whereas banks that also keep an eye on profitability and  productivity will increase their focus on non-interest revenue items due to the  changing interest margins.</p>
<p>The  expansion in lending is expected to continue in a balanced manner during 2013,  owing mostly to the effect of the SME and consumer loans. The rate of growth is  anticipated to be 14-16% for lending and 12-14% for deposits in the coming  year.</p>
