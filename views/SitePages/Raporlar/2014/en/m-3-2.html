<h2>A key Ziraat Bank goal and priority consists of fostering and strengthening a customer-focused business culture throughout the Bank and of increasing customer satisfaction in all segments.</h2>
<h6>G4-DMA, G4-EC7, G4-EC8, G4-FS7, G4-FS14, G4-PR5</h6>
<h1>Customer focus is a fundamental issue for Ziraat Bank.</h1>
<p>In order to create a truly customer-focused business culture it is just  as necessary to effectively manage information and include customers in  business processes as it is to do the right thing in the right way. This  approach makes it possible to analyze customers&rsquo; wishes, satisfaction levels,  and willingness to recommend the bank to others while also pointing to the  organizational changes that are needed to achieve this.</p>
<p>Similarly, companies that have truly internalized a customer-focused  business culture are also more likely to have customers who are happily  satisfied as well as employees who are highly motivated. This convergence is an  important part of making and keeping a business enterprise sustainable.</p>
<h1>Ziraat Bank is mindful of customer satisfaction in all of its  business processes.</h1>
<p>Customers are ultimately one of the reasons for Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s existence and that is also why they occupy such a crucial place  in the corporate structure that the bank has been building since 1863.  Recognizing the centrality of customer-focused banking, Ziraat Bank has been standing by its customers and supporting them during even  the most trying times for over a century and a half.</p>
<h1>Change &amp; Transformation Project: Enhanced productivity</h1>
<p>Initiated and comprehensively carried out at Ziraat Bank in order to provide customers with the right value at the right  time and in the right way, the Change &amp; Transformation Project has already  brought about significant improvements in the effectiveness and productivity of  the Bank&rsquo;s:</p>
<ul>
	<li>operations</li>
	<li>customer relations</li>
	<li>lending policies and processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The story of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  success in this endeavor was reported to the extensive readership of Harvard  Business Review Türkiye in an article that appeared in the  October 2014 issue of that magazine.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank supplies banking and financial  products and services through the Turkish banking industry&rsquo;s biggest and most  extensive branch network consisting of 1,682 service points as well as a  variety of alternative delivery channels. Besides giving its customers  convenient access to its offerings, Ziraat Bank  also enjoys a position as a preferred business partner owing to its ability to  come up with fast and efficient solutions to customers&rsquo; technology needs.</p>
<p>Addressing all three customer segments -corporate, entrepreneurial, and  retail- Ziraat Bank has the ability to go on  increasing the value it creates year after year thanks both to its deep-rooted  knowledge and experience and to its extensive portfolio of domestic and  international subsidiaries.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">

	<strong>19%</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank’s total assets increased by 19% and reached TL 247.6 billion.
	<div class="bg-acikgri" style="margin-top:20px;">
	Ziraat Bank introduced a lot of innovations as a result of the “channel optimization” activities during 2014. 
	</div>
</h2>


<h1>Projects to improve service delivery effectiveness continue  without letup.</h1>
<p>Seeking to further strengthen the solid and sustainable relationships  that it has with its existing customers, Ziraat Bank improved and expanded its contacts and dealings with them in every  channel. Some of the innovations introduced as a result of the optimization of  the Bank&rsquo;s branch and non-branch channels during 2014 are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s website for its corporate  customers was renovated and a mobile banking app was developed for them.</li>
	<li>A new feature called &ldquo;Avans Bankkart&rdquo; that  was added to Ziraat Bank-issued debit cards allows  collections to be deferred when the cards are used to pay for domestic,  international, and online purchases without being subject to any merchant or  amount limits and without any interest being charged. In December 2014 the Bank  introduced its &ldquo;Combo Kart&rdquo;, a  product designed for younger customers that combines the features of both a  credit card and a debit card.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Hızlı Başakkart&rdquo; was launched. This is essentially a  version of the Bank&rsquo;s existing Başakkart product  intended for agricultural sector customers whose issuance procedures have been  streamlined and speeded up.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s retail banking applications were  updated and the transaction set was further expanded.</li>
	<li>With the introduction of a mobile banking app, it is now possible for  online and mobile banking customers to perform banking transactions without the  need for passcodes.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank Mobile ATM units went into service  in 2014.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s marketing and sales functions  were separated from each other and both headquarters and regional  organizational structures were revised accordingly. Data analysis and screen  design projects that are currently in progress will allow branches to get to  know and serve their customers better.</li>
	<li>The branch and non-branch channel design work of the &ldquo;Banking Without  Barriers&rdquo; project that will make it easier for physically-challenged customers  to access financial services has been completed. A pilot project is currently  under way.</li>
	<li>The IT systems of Ziraat Bank  and of Ziraat Hayat Emeklilik, the Bank&rsquo;s life insurance and pension  provider subsidiary, have been fully integrated in line with the goal of  enabling customers to take care of all of their financial product and service  needs within the Ziraat Finance Group.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Proactive service quality management through more productive  lending processes</h1>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank once again continued to improve  its existing creditworthiness-assessment modules and lending processes in order  to increase its credit-placement competencies. In line with the Bank&rsquo;s strategy  of focusing on Branch Banking, a new assessment module designed specifically  for small businesses was added to existing assessment modules and went into use  in October of the year.</p>
<h1>Ziraat Finance Group Quality Policy</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s goal is to formulate a &ldquo;Ziraat  Finance Group Quality Policy&rdquo; in order to support its ongoing development, to  systematically quantify process performance, to improve processes consistently  with strategic priorities and budget targets, and to deliver the same levels of  quality and service not just within the Bank but in all of its subsidiaries  too.</p>

<h1>Customer satisfaction: Digital platforms and field research</h1>
<p>Ziraat Bank engages in efforts to ensure that  its corporate identity is used in accordance with Bank-specified standards so  that its brand image is correctly perceived among customers, that its corporate  identity is properly integrated into all appropriate environments, and that any  misapprehensions of the Ziraat brand and identity are avoided.

SMEs are the most dynamic elements of the Turkish economy and account for substantial shares of the country’s total employment (78%), added value creation (55%), investment (50%), and exports (59%). 

</h2>


<p><strong>The  Small-Business Model allows loan applications to be responded to more quickly.</strong><br />
In 2014 Ziraat Bank continued to engage in activities  and to work on projects aimed at accelerating and simplifying lending processes  while also making its risk management functions more effective. In line with  this the Bank launched a new Small-Business Model (KİM) which ensures that the  creditworthiness of individual and groups of startup-segment small-business  customers is assessed and quantified:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In line with the Bank&rsquo;s corporate risk perceptions</li>
	<li>In a manner stripped of all subjectivity</li>
	<li>Quickly and accurately.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is structured so as to make it possible for loan applications  to be evaluated and finalized quickly.</p>
<h6>G4-FS7</h6>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank&rsquo;s goals with this model are to  increase the ability of microbusinesses in particular to create and sustain  employment by strengthening their operational capabilities and in this way to  have a strong and positive social impact.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The  design and development of special products and services for startup  microbusinesses gained momentum in 2014.</strong><br />
	The businesses collectively referred to as &ldquo;small- and medium-sized  enterprises&rdquo; (SME) form the backbone of the Turkish economy and account for  substantial shares of the country&rsquo;s total employment (78%), added value  creation (55%), investment (50%), and exports (59%). What&rsquo;s more, SMEs are  widely recognized as the most dynamic elements of the national economy.</p>
<p>In the last quarter of 2014, Ziraat Bank  decided to expand its focus on this segment in parallel with the increasingly  greater importance of SMEs in the global and Turkish economies. The immediate  outcome of this decision was the creation of a Startup Microbusiness Marketing  department at the Bank, the aim of which is to take a fully professional  approach in the startup-business and small-business banking lines.</p>
<p>By means of analytical customer relationship management, Ziraat Bank models customer data to determine not just what particular mixes of  products and services should be offered to which customers but also when and  through what channels these offerings should take place. Similarly, customers&rsquo;  financial market product and service needs are also analyzed and the results of  these analyses are used to generate cross-sale opportunities through Ziraat  subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank has reached the final stage in its  proliferation of the product and service packages that it puts together for  different sectors. It will begin offering these packages to the appropriate  customer groups in 2015.</p>
<h6>G4-FS14</h6>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank introduced its &ldquo;Pharmacy Services  Package&rdquo; for pharmacist customers. In addition to profession/trade-specific  packages like this, the Bank also offers such customers a range of credit  products capable of addressing their particular needs such as loans to buy  places of business and vehicles and to pay commercial vehicle registration  fees. Work has begun on a &ldquo;Services Without Barriers&rdquo; package of products and  services designed to help people with physical disabilities to run their own  businesses. It is planned to introduce this product in 2015.</p>

<h2 class="sag cizgi">
<img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/Raporlar/2014/images/icon22.png" class="floatleft" />
Ziraat Bank provided TL 13.8 million worth of financing support to Akçakale and Ceylanpınar townships to activate the economy. 
</h2>


<p><strong>New  procedures are being introduced to make it easier for startups and SMEs to make  use of credit.</strong><br />
The majority of the assets owned by those engaged in production  activities in Turkey consist of movable properties (chattels), which the  country&rsquo;s banks are often reluctant to accept as collateral. Moreover the legal  framework governing chattels is fragmented and inconsistent and is subject to  several independent and incompatible registration systems. All of this makes  chattel-based lending problematic in Turkey.</p>
<p>In recognition of this, Ziraat Bank  is taking part in a project, which is being coordinated by the Treasury  Undersecretariat, to prepare the draft of a comprehensive Secured Transactions  Act that will make it easier for SMEs and producers to borrow against their  movable assets.</p>
<p>Examples of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s activities in this area in 2014  are presented below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Under new rules introduced recently by tax authorities, all merchants  are required to make use of so-called &ldquo;new-generation payment-recording  devices&rdquo; (smart-terminal cash registers) in the conduct of their business. To  ease the changeover to this system, Ziraat Bank  has completely integrated itself into the Electronic Payment System and has  also been conducting campaigns to make it easier for its startup and SME  customers to acquire these units.</li>
	<li>Under a cash loan suretyship project undertaken jointly with the  European Investment Fund (EIF), a total of TL&nbsp;1.3 billion in cash credit  was disbursed to microbusinesses which had been active for five years or less,  which employed at most nine people, whose annual turnover did not exceed the  equivalent of EUR&nbsp;2 million, and which had difficulties posting  collateral. Under this program, which ended as of 31 December 2014, financial  support was provided to microbusinesses against the personal guarantees of  their owners. EIF guarantees covered 75% of such loans.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank signed a protocol with Credit  Guarantee Fund Incorporated (KGF) setting out principles and procedures  pertaining to the guarantees of &ldquo;microloan&rdquo; credit products supplied to  microbusinesses under the fund&rsquo;s &ldquo;Portfolio Guarantee System&rdquo;. The TL&nbsp;5  million worth of credit covered by the first phase of this agreement was lent  out within the first two days of the program. Work is currently in progress to  lend out the TL&nbsp;10 million that is being made available to Ziraat Bank customers in the second phase of the KGF program.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Non-Export FX Credit&rdquo; is a foreign-currency loan product for customers  who cannot give export guarantees but who nevertheless have FX earnings owing  to rent or other receivables.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support  for KOSGEB members suffering from hardship</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank signed a &ldquo;Working Capital Loan  Support&rdquo; protocol with the Small and Medium Enterprises Development  Organization (KOSGEB) to provide credit support to the organization&rsquo;s members  in Manisa province&rsquo;s Soma and Kırkağaç  townships, where economic activity was hampered by a coal mine disaster, and  also to those in Şanlıurfa province&rsquo;s Akçakale and Ceylanpınar townships, which  have suffered greatly from the violence in Syria just over the border.</p>
<p>Under this agreement, Ziraat Bank  provided TL&nbsp;13.8 million worth of KOSGEB financing support to small  businesses in the four townships.</p>
<h1>International Collaboration to Provide More Resources to the  Real Sector </h1>
<p><strong>Under  the heading of its international collaborations, in 2014 Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank continued to steadily expand the  total volume of resources that it makes available to the real sector for use in  domestic and international business projects.</strong></p>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank continued to tap international  financial institutions for resources that it could use to provide financing  support to small, medium, and larger-sized businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance  with environmental laws and regulations; restricted lists</strong><br />
Although the credit agreements that Ziraat Bank enters with international financial institutions contains specific  provisions pertaining to environmental and social impact, general compliance  with current environmental laws and regulations is a requirement of them all.  Such agreements may also contain lists of businesses that are exposed to  particular environmental risks and/or are not to be financed.</p>
<p>As a requirement of lending agreements entered into with international  financial institutions, SME customers that receive financing through Ziraat Bank must sign an addendum to their main loan agreement in which they  specifically commit themselves to abide by the particular environmental and  social terms stipulated by the prime lender.</p>
<p>During the reporting period, representatives of the international  financial institutions with which Ziraat Bank  collaborates conducted inspections at the Bank and at borrowers&rsquo; places of  business to check for compliance with such terms.</p>
Information about the credit agreements that  Ziraat Bank has entered into with international  financial institutions and the borrowers these agreements apply to is  summarized below.
<h6>G4-FS8</h6>
<p><strong>World  Bank credit for SMEs and larger-sized enterprises</strong><br />
Owing to their flexible repayment terms and periods of grace and to  their ability to serve as long-term investment financing and operating capital,  World Bank credit ranks among the value-creating financial solution and support  options that Ziraat Bank offers. In 2014 the Bank continued  to supply its customers with World Bank-sourced loans.</p>
<p>In May 2013 Ziraat Bank signed a USD&nbsp;67 million  credit agreement with the World Bank under which Ziraat Bank undertook to finance the energy-efficiency investments of SMEs and  larger-sized enterprises. As per this agreement, in 2014 Ziraat Bank began lending to its customers resources in the form of a grant  received from the Global Energy Fund. As also required by the agreement, Ziraat Bank is working with a consultancy to provide such customers with the  technical support that they need to carry out their energy efficiency projects.</p>
<p>In August 2013 Ziraat Bank  signed an &ldquo;Enhancing SME Access to Finance Project&rdquo; agreement with the World  Bank. Under this project Ziraat Bank  received USD&nbsp;300 million worth of funding to be supplied to SMEs both  through leasing companies and through banks licensed to provide leasing  products and services.</p>
<p>These resources were supplied to leasing companies during 2014. While  encouraging SMEs to support their growth plans through leasing-financed  investments, this program had the additional benefit of giving the Turkish  leasing industry access to medium- and long-term funding as well.</p>
<p><strong>EIB  credit financing for SMEs and larger-sized enterprises</strong><br />
	In 2012 Ziraat Bank and the European Investment Bank  (EIB) signed an agreement to supply a total of EUR&nbsp;100 million in  financing to SMEs. The last of these EIB resources were lent out in 2014 not  only to finance projects that supported SMEs&rsquo; growth by increasing their  output, productivity, and job-creation capabilities but also to provide SMEs  with operating capital and investment financing needed to undertake investments  in Turkey capable of reducing interregional disparities in development levels.</p>
<p>Such was the success of this program that EIB authorized granting Ziraat Bank a second round of funding in the amount of EUR&nbsp;200 million. An  agreement covering the first EUR&nbsp;100 million tranche of this was signed in  September 2013, after which Ziraat Bank  began lending it out to SMEs and larger-sized enterprises. Disbursements of the  first tranche were completed in 2014. An agreement covering the second  EUR&nbsp;100 million tranche was signed in July of the same year and the  process of lending it out to SMEs and larger-sized enterprises to meet their  investment financing and operating capital needs began immediately thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>The  first IPARD credit to be granted to a bank in Turkey</strong><br />
In the wake of these successfully undertaken projects, Ziraat Bank began exploring ways in which to expand the scope of its  collaboration with EIB into other areas as well. One outcome of this was the  signing, in September 2014, of a 14-year Instrument For Pre-Accession  Assistance In Rural Development (IPARD) agreement to provide EUR&nbsp;100  million worth of credit to finance rural development projects in Turkey.</p>
<p>This line of credit, which is to be used to fund projects that have been  approved by the Turkish Agricultural and Rural Development Support Agency  (TKDK), is not only the first IPARD agreement that EIB has entered into with a  bank in Turkey but is also the longest-term agreement which EIB has entered  into with any Turkish bank. These resources are to be lent out to  microbusinesses as well as to SMEs and larger-sized enterprises in order to  help overcome the difficulties that rural areas have when accessing financing.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">Ziraat Bank continues to diversify its collaborations with international financial institutions in order to supply its customers with value-creating financial solutions that are both right for their needs and compatible with its own customer-focused business model.</h2>

<p><strong>EIB-guaranteed  &ldquo;My First Business/My First Bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;Young Entrepreneur&rdquo; loans</strong><br />
The goal of this project is to support young entrepreneurs and to  enhance SMEs&rsquo; access to funding by enabling them to finance their activities  without the need for obtaining additional guarantees. The project got under way  with an initial TL&nbsp;300 million line of credit supported by EIB  guarantees. This amount was increased first to TL&nbsp;1.3 billion and then  again to TL&nbsp;2.1 billion under annex agreements signed in 2013 and 2014.  The entire project, which was intended to support tradesmen and artisans as  well as new firms in need of collateral and startup capital, was wound up as of  end-2014.</p>
<p><strong>Saudi  Export Program (SEP)</strong><br />
	In 2013 Ziraat Bank secured a USD&nbsp;50 million line  of credit from the Saudi Export Program to finance the importation of goods of  Saudi Arabian origin into Turkey. Disbursements, which began the same year,  continued successfully in 2014 as well. Under this program, customers who  import a wide range of goods other than petroleum from that country are  provided with low-cost financing on terms of up to three years to pay for them.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank-KfW collaboration in  priority-development regions</strong><br />
	In June 2014 Ziraat Bank  signed a 10-year agreement with the German Development Bank (KfW) to supply EUR&nbsp;150  million in financing to SMEs that are located in rural areas or are part of the  agricultural value-creation chain. Under this project credit is now being  provided to micro-, small-, and medium-segment customers whose businesses are  based in &ldquo;priority-development regions&rdquo; or in a few other localities that are  stipulated in the agreement. The goals of this KfW project are to help reduce  interregional disparities in development levels and to provide medium- and  long-term financing support to firms involved in the agricultural  value-creation chain.</p>
<p><strong>AFD  support for SMEs that process animal-source foods</strong><br />
	In December 2014 Ziraat Bank  signed a twelve-year agreement with the French Development Agency (AFD) to  supply a total of EUR&nbsp;100 million in financing to agricultural-sector SMEs  that process animal-source foods.</p>
<p>Under the terms of this agreement, whose aim is to ensure that  end-consumers have access to safe and wholesome food, loans are to be provided  to SMEs engaged in the non-primary (<em>ie</em> other than animal husbandry) aspects of animal-source food production in order  to finance modernization projects that will bring them into compliance with EU  hygiene and environment standards and with the requirements of Turkish law  governing veterinary services, plant health, food, and feed (Statute 5996).</p>

<p><strong>Joint  Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank-CEB support  to improve employment conditions among microbusinesses and SMEs</strong><br />
	In December 2014 a seven-year agreement was signed with the Council of  Europe Development Bank (CEB) to provide a total of EUR&nbsp;50 million in  credit through Ziraat Finansal Kiralama  AŞ, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s leasing subsidiary. The main  goals of this project are to help micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises  create new jobs and to improve their ability to protect existing ones. Other  goals include creating a positive social impact and supporting the leasing  industry.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank continues to collaborate with  international financial institutions in an ongoing effort to expand its product  lineup in ways that will give its customers a financial competitive advantage.</strong></p>
<p>Ziraat Bank expects to be making the following  credit packages available to its customers in 2015.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The second tranche of EIB credit financing for SMEs and larger-sized  enterprises. The agreement covering this project to supply SMEs and  larger-sized enterprises with operating capital and investment financing has  been signed.</li>
	<li>EIB IPARD credit: Under this agreement, which has been signed, Ziraat Bank will be supplying IPARD credit to support the TKDK standard-compliant production,  processing, packaging, and marketing of meat, dairy, fish, poultry, fruit,  vegetable, and seafood products and to finance rural-area projects such as  tourism, handicrafts, etc.</li>
	<li>CEB SME credit: The agreement for this project has been signed.</li>

<h1>Ziraat Bank and Agricultural Sector</h1>
<p><strong>Originally  founded in 1863 to support agricultural endeavors, in the 151 years since then  Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank has:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>played  a key role in efforts to make Turkey&rsquo;s agricultural sector more modern, more  productive, and more competitive</strong></li>
	<li><strong>made  substantial and systematic contributions to the sector&rsquo;s advancement</strong></li>
	<li><strong>been the partner,  supporter, and bank of tens of millions of farmers.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As Turkey&rsquo;s leading supplier of credit and loans for  agricultural endeavors, Ziraat Bank seeks firstly to be a customer&rsquo;s primary and proactive bank  in all aspects of agricultural production up to and including the final  consumer in order to strengthen both individual producers and agroindustry and  help both become internationally competitive and secondly to contribute to the  growth and development of agroindustry by simultaneously supporting all links  in the agricultural value-creation chain.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening Turkey&rsquo;s agricultural sector and helping it to  become internationally competitive</strong><br />
	Continuing to provide financing support in parallel with  national agriculture policy for the creation and modernization of agricultural  enterprises that are equipped with new technologies and are big enough to  benefit from economies of scale, Ziraat Bank seeks to increase the share of high-added-value products in  total production through agricultural finance resource diversification. To this  end, the Bank will continue to diversify its financial product offerings, to  revise existing ones in line with requirements, and to be the first address  that agricultural-sector customers have recourse to when they are in need of  financing.</p>
<p><strong>Total agricultural-sector financing credit reached TL&nbsp;27.8  billion in value in 2014.</strong><br />
	Supporting all aspects of agricultural endeavors from  production to consumption through its agricultural banking activities, Ziraat Bank constantly both its  resources and its financing.</p>
<p>As of end-2014:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s total lendings to  finance the agricultural sector amounted to TL&nbsp;27.8 billion while the  number of its credit customers reached 607,197.</li>
	<li>Credit and loans amounting to TL&nbsp;16.8 billion had been  provided to 351,181 individual and corporate customers from the Bank&rsquo;s own  resources while another TL&nbsp;491 million from special-purpose funds had  been provided to 18,194 people.</li>
	<li>42% of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s agricultural loan portfolio consisted of investment credit  worth TL&nbsp;10,704 million while the remaining 58%, worth TL&nbsp;14,829  million, consisted of operating credit.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="sag cizgi">During 2014, 219,000 customers charged TL 3.2 billion worth of their aggregate TL 4.2 billion agricultural credit limit using Başakkart at Ziraat Bank.</h2>

<p><strong>Başakkart</strong><strong> continues to reduce the burden of financing production processes.</strong><br />
	Başakkart, the principal bankcard  and financing tool that Ziraat Bank provides to its agricultural-sector customers, helps reduce  the burden of financing agricultural production processes by making it easier  for producers to get credit.</p>
<p>With Başakkart, agricultural enterprises have the ability to finance
their production processes by purchasing such inputs as fuel,
seed, fertilizer, pesticides, feed, and veterinary services on interestfree
terms of up to five months. During 2014, 219,000 customers
charged TL 3.2 billion worth of their aggregate TL 4.2 billion
agricultural credit limit using Başakkart at Ziraat Bank.</p>
<p>A new-generation Başakkart issued in 2014 and the ability of  agricultural-sector customers to obtain cards immediately just by walking into  a Ziraat Bank branch made it possible for them  to take care of their banking business faster and more conveniently.</p>
<p><strong>A financial model that contributes to agroindustry-producer  collaboration</strong><br />
	In 2014 Ziraat Bank signed protocol agreements with eighteen firms that are purveyors  of seed and other supplies to producers of sugar beets, farmed trout, and  poultry.</p>
<p>Under these protocols, the aggregate  credit limit of which amounts to TL&nbsp;131 million, the Bank extends  operating and investment credit to about 16,200 of the firms&rsquo; contractual  customers.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion of the interest-free livestock credit program</strong><br />
In August 2010 Ziraat Bank began offering its customers interest-free livestock credit in order to meet the financing needs both of  new livestock enterprises and of modernization and capacity-expansion projects  to be undertaken by existing livestock breeding and feedlot operations.</p>
<p>In 2014 the Bank disbursed cash loans  amounting to TL 831 million to 48,897 customers under this program. Since the  introduction of the interest-free livestock credit program in 2010, Ziraat Bank has supplied TL&nbsp;7.9 billion worth of such funding to 298,198  customers.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainable animal husbandry in Turkey</strong><br />
In support of animal husbandry in  Turkey, Ziraat Bank develops projects that will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>increase the number of livestock being raised and ensure that animal  husbandry operations are conducted sustainably,</li>
	<li>permit essential financing needs to be satisfied more effectively,</li>
	<li>give producers more convenient access to the credit they require,</li>
	<li>contribute to the national economy by giving animal husbandry the  broadest possible assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>One example of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s efforts in  this direction is a project that the Bank is working on with the agriculture  ministry to develop acceptable forms of collateral other than real estate  properties that will make it easier for farmers to obtain credit. Under this  project, the animal lien registry&rsquo;s technological infrastructure is being  upgraded and integrated with those of the government&rsquo;s TÜRKVET (veterinary  information) and KKKS (sheep and goat registry) systems.</p>
<p><strong>Since 2004, TL&nbsp;5,877 million worth of fixed-rate tractor  financing loans have been extended.</strong><br />
In 2014 Ziraat Bank extended fixed-rate tractor financing loans amounting to  TL&nbsp;1,583 million to 35,749 customers. Since this credit product was  originally launched in 2004, TL 5,877 million worth of such loans have been  extended to 169,686 of the Bank&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<p><strong>TL&nbsp;2.5 billion worth of credit for commercial greenhouse  enterprises in eleven years</strong><br />
	In 2014 Ziraat Bank extended TL&nbsp;440 million worth of commercial greenhouse  financing loans to 6,138 customers. Over the last eleven years, 89,697  customers have received a total of TL&nbsp;2.5 billion in credit and loans to  finance their greenhouse construction, modernization, and production  operations.</p>
<p><strong>Pressurized irrigation system credit from Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank</strong><br />
	In 2014 Ziraat Bank extended a total of TL&nbsp;215 million worth of loans to  finance the modern pressurized irrigation system projects of 6,238 of its  customers. Through its involvement in these projects, which have so far brought  about the installation of modern pressurized irrigation systems on about  540,000 decares of land, Ziraat Bank  helps expand the amount of arable land in Turkey. </p>
<p><strong>Broad-based Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank payment systems at the service of agriculture</strong><br />
In 2014 Ziraat Bank once again served as the main conduit for government payments  to farmers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>TL&nbsp;8,616 million worth of price-support payments were made  to 4,413,082 individual producers and their associations</li>
	<li>TL&nbsp;113 million worth of payments were made on behalf of the  Turkish Grain Board</li>
	<li>TL&nbsp;655 million worth of payments and advances were processed  on behalf of Türkiye Şeker Fabrikaları AŞ, the state-owned sugar  mills company.</li>
</ul>


<h6>G4-DMA</h6>

<p><strong>Single-digit interest rates on agricultural credit and loans</strong><br />
	In 2013 Ziraat Bank reduced the rates of interest that it charged on agricultural  credit to 8% in the case of loans with maturities of a year or less, to 10% in  the case of loans with one to four-year maturities, and to 11% in the case of  loans with maturities of more than four years. This meant that the effective  interest rates on loans to customers qualifying for crop and other subsidies  governed by Council of Ministers decrees were in the 0% to 8.25% range.</p>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank extended TL&nbsp;13.2 billion worth of reduced-rate loans to  289,579 individual and corporate customers.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank also offers  reduced-rate loans to agricultural enterprises to finance projects with such  aims as protecting, conserving, and developing natural resources; making  production operations more environmentally sustainable; improving food crop  quality and engaging in organic farming and computer-controlled greenhouse  cultivation; and complying with good agricultural practices. Reduced-rate loans  are also provided to customers investing in projects aimed at deriving energy  from renewable sources such as solar and biomass.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">In all of the financing projects Ziraat Bank was involved during 2014, as much attention was given to environmental and social-impact issues as it was to national economic benefit.</h2>
<h6>G4-SO1</h6>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank continued to interact with its agricultural-sector  stakeholders on different platforms in a variety of ways.</strong><br />
In 2014 Ziraat Bank once again took part in sector-oriented activities while also  supporting activities aimed at increasing individuals&rsquo; financial awareness and literacy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bank representatives took part in fourteen fairs in which the  exhibits of 3,000 firms were seen by 917,433 visitors. The Bank also sponsored  fourteen events organized by various sectoral associations and cooperatives.</li>
	<li>Meetings that were organized for sectoral associations at various  times were attended by about 2,000 people. During such gatherings, bank  representatives conducted presentations and contributed to the improvement of  participants&rsquo; financial literacy.</li>

<h1>Project Finance and Sustainability</h1>
<p>Supplying its customers with value-creating financial  solutions that are both right for their needs and compatible with its own  customer-focused business model, Ziraat Bank carries out its project finance  activities so as to simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
	<li>expand its product lineup</li>
	<li>give its customers a financial competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all of the financing projects Ziraat Bank was involved during  2014, as much attention was given to environmental and social-impact issues as  it was to national economic benefit.</p>
<p>Projects to recycle wastepaper, highway construction  projects intended to achieve economies of fuel and time in transportation,  renewable energy projects, projects to prevent electrical power  grid fraud and theft, and projects to create local jobs by exploiting new  production opportunities are among the projects to which such consideration was  given. </p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank gives importance to environmental and social risk  assessment in project finance.</strong><br />
	In the conduct of project finance, Ziraat Bank has environmental and  social impact assessments carried out and it draws up specifically-termed  lending agreements as particular circumstances may require.</p>
<p>The international financial institutions with which Ziraat Bank frequently  collaborates are especially scrupulous about the projects that the Bank  finances being in compliance with national laws and regulations and with  international norms pertaining to environmental issues. They do not  approve projects with the potential to cause substantial environmental harm  unless the projects have been duly licensed and are adequately financed. </p>
<p>Similarly when working on projects in which international  financial institutions are involved, Ziraat Bank requires and oversees the conduct of an environmental impact  study as part of its creditworthiness assessment. Projects whose environmental  risks are deemed to be unacceptably high are rejected and not financed.</p>
<p>When considering a project finance application, Ziraat Bank requires the investors  and/or customers to submit either an approved environmental impact assessment  (EIA) report or else an official ruling that such a report is not necessary. The  Bank also demands that all of the licenses and permissions required by a  project be obtained from the authorities concerned and be submitted to it for  its own inspection. In situations where this documentation is not forthcoming,  the absence is noted in the Bank&rsquo;s reports and the point is stressed that this  lack must be taken into account when making any decision to lend.</p>
<p>During 2014 Ziraat Bank appointed environmental consultants to oversee, monitor, and  report on eight active projects. </p>

Whenever Ziraat Bank is involved in the financing of a project being undertaken by  a consortium of which the International Finance Corporation (IFC) or European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are members, the project  documentation includes investors&rsquo; pledges to abide by IFC performance standards  and the Equator Principles as may be applicable.</p>
<p>In such cases, compliance with these additional criteria is  monitored and reported on by technical and/or environmental consultants.</p>
<p>During 2014 there were no reported instances of any  contraventions of such criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank is increasing its financing support for renewable  energy projects</strong>.<br />
	Turkey&rsquo;s existing energy resources are insufficient to meet  demand and this significantly increases the country&rsquo;s dependence on energy  imports. Furthermore the present intensive use of fossil fuels results in  environmentally harmful emissions besides being expensive and subject to rapid  resource depletion. For these and other reasons  therefore increasingly greater attention is being given to renewable energy  resources and to the technologies needed to exploit them. In line with such  considerations, Ziraat Bank provides financing support to renewable energy projects such  as hydroelectric power plants, wind power plants, and solar power plants not  only for their environmental benefits but also to  reduce imported energy dependency and to support sustainable economic growth  through the use of locally-available resources. The Bank is currently working  on the development of financing packages capable of addressing the needs of  small-scale undertakings in this business line.</p>
<p>In order to finance energy efficiency investments and  projects, Ziraat Bank has received a World  Bank line of credit from which it extends loans to customers on terms of up to  eight years, during the first two of which principal need not be repaid.</p>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank supplied credit financing to hydroelectric, thermal, wind,  and geothermal power plant projects. Particular attention was given to the  financing of solar power plant and wind power plant projects.</p>

	<div class="bg-acikgri">Ziraat Bank develops financing packages capable of addressing the needs of small-scale undertakings.</div>
</h2>
<p>The environmental, social, and economic benefits which were  achieved in 2014 through the active energy projects being financed by Ziraat Bank are summarized below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>These projects create employment opportunities for local  communities while also reducing dependence on external energy resources.</li>
	<li>As sources of clean and sustainable energy, renewable energy  projects reduce fossil fuel consumption and help counter the greenhouse effects  which such consumption contributes to.</li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank provides financing  support to private-sector firms building military vessels under contracts with  the Ministry of National Defense and the Navy Department. Besides encouraging  domestic industry and manufacturing, this project also creates employment  opportunities for the Turkish workers and engineers employed on them.</li>
</ul>
<h6>G4-FS11</h6>
<p>Two of the projects being financed by Ziraat Bank were deemed to be  exposed to potentially unacceptable levels of environmental risk. In one  instance, a suit that was lodged against the project&rsquo;s favorable EIA report  resulted in the report&rsquo;s suspension on the grounds that  its terms were not being complied with, whereupon the  Bank&rsquo;s lending to the project was also suspended. An environmental consultant  is to be appointed to conduct a review and assessment of the project&rsquo;s  environmental risks and then report to the members of the financing consortium  on whether or not the project&rsquo;s non-compliance with environmental laws and  regulations has been rectified.</p>
<p>In the other instance, the favorable EIA report of a project  being financed by Ziraat Bank was cancelled but a  new (and also favorable) report was obtained the same year. An environmental  consultant has been appointed to monitor and report on the situation. The Bank  is keeping a close watch on these reports in order to determine both whether or  not the project owners are fulfilling their environmental commitments and  whether or not the project is in compliance with environmental laws and  regulations.</p>
<p>These two projects together account for 9% and 1% shares of  the Bank&rsquo;s overall loan portfolio as measured by lending limits and risk  exposure respectively. No bank-financed project was deemed to be in breach of  its lending agreement terms in 2014.</p>
<h1>Environmental and Social Risk Assessment at Ziraat Bank </h1>
<p>The criteria that Ziraat Bank makes use of when determining a project&rsquo;s environmental and  social risks within the framework of its borrower assessment methodology (system)  are summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>When evaluating agricultural projects,</strong> points are given for  the inclusion of &ldquo;Good Agricultural Practices&rdquo; and for adherence to &ldquo;Organic  Farming&rdquo; criteria and practices. The inclusion of such practices impacts  favorably on a customer&rsquo;s risk score.</p>
<p><strong>In the case of manufacturing firms</strong> and the compliance of  their production facilities, the absence of installations such as ecological  purification, flue filtration, and similar systems in sectors where such  equipment is deemed to be necessary or whose use is legally mandated results in  &ldquo;negative&rdquo; points that reduce the project&rsquo;s overall score.</p>
<p><strong>In both agricultural and manufacturing sector projects,  </strong>attention is given to such criteria as the environmental impact of  production/manufacturing processes, whether or not such processes have been  properly set up so as to be sustainable, and the appropriateness of the location  selected for the project. Both before and after financing is provided,  projects&rsquo; compliance with stipulated criteria is described in investment  monitoring reports. Instances of non-compliance are referred to appropriate Bank  units so that action may be taken as required. </p>
<p>The results of onsite inspections are readily accessible to  appropriate personnel via the Bank&rsquo;s internal system. Whenever a  customer or project is deemed to be in breach of their terms as a result of an  inspection, this fact is made known and bank personnel are able to monitor the  progress of the issue. This approach ensures that projects&rsquo; environmental auditing  processes are conducted fairly and transparently throughout Ziraat Bank. </p>

<h2 class="sag cizgi">No Ziraat Bank-financed project was deemed
	to be in breach of its lending agreement
	terms in 2014.</h2>


<p><strong>Attention is also given to social impact in project finance.</strong><br />
While the credit agreements that Ziraat Bank has entered into with  international financial institutions contain no specific provisions pertaining  to human rights, agreements with the World Bank do stipulate that  projects and sub-projects in whose financing that institution is involved must  not result in the involuntary relocation of local communities. In other words  compulsory purchases of land for these projects are prohibited under these  agreements. </p>
<p><strong>Further strengthening our environmental and social risk management  mechanisms</strong><br />
	In 2015 Ziraat Bank plans to provide SMEs with food safety and quality  consultancy services to improve their internal capacity to deal with such  issues. Through such projects, the Bank will be seeking to engage with its SME  customers in order to increase both their awareness of good agricultural  practices and their ability to comply with them. </p>
<p>Another of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s priorities in 2015 will be to undertake projects that will  strengthen both its own environmental and social risk management mechanisms and  those of its customers as well. The Bank plans to engage an outside firm to act  as a consultant on matters related to the formulation of a comprehensive  Ziraat Bank corporate responsibility and  social responsibility policy so that the environmental and social risks  inherent in its portfolio may be managed more consistently and effectively. </p>
<h1>Creating Value for Public Agencies and Organizations</h1>
<p><strong>In its capacity as a state-owned financial institution, Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank seeks to interact with  other public agencies and organizations in a </strong><strong>coherent and  effective manner.</strong></p>
<p>Ziraat Bank is the primary conduit  through which public-sector disbursements and receipts flow in Turkey. Every year the Bank handles tens of  millions of payments on behalf of many different public agencies and  organizations while also serving as the main channel for disbursements made in  line with government social policy.</p>
<p>In 2014, Ziraat Bank focused attention on increasing the number of branches  actively involved in the provision of these services while also supplying  increasingly more financial products and services to firms that serve the  public sector.</p>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank successfully handled:<br />
	• Agricultural Support Payments<br />
	• Home-ownership Assistance Payments<br />
	• Employee Savings Incentive Payments<br />
	• Payment/Collection Protocol Transfers</p>

<h1>Services that Make a Difference </h1>
<p><strong>As of end-2014, the number of Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank&rsquo;s retail  (non-corporate) customers topped 30.4 million.</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank is continuing, with no  loss of momentum, projects aimed at delivering service that makes a difference  in all branch and non-branch channels through a process of  channel optimization that is in line with its projects to supply its customers  with effective banking service in every possible way.</p>
<p>In 2014 the Bank made intensive use of alternative delivery channels in  order to appeal and reach out to a numerically greater customer audience.</p>
<p>The performance highlights achieved as a result of services  supplied through the Bank&rsquo;s electronic delivery channels in 2014 are presented  below.</p>

<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank continues to introduce innovative new practices and  processes to the Turkish banking industry.</strong><br />
	One of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s unwavering objectives is to keep its customers supplied  with banking products and services in formats that are intelligible and  practical. In 2014 the Bank continued to introduce  innovative new practices and processes to the Turkish banking industry.</p>
<p><strong>Pensioner loyalty program</strong><br />
	A loyalty program called &ldquo;Retirement Plus at Ziraat&rdquo; has  been designed for retirees who receive their monthly pension payments through  Ziraat Bank. The Bank has entered  into agreements not only with its own subsidiaries (Ziraat Life &amp; Pension,  Ziraat Insurance, and Ziraat Securities) but also with independent firms that  are active in such businesses as travel, tourism, and the like under which the  Bank&rsquo;s pensioner customers qualify for a variety of discounts.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">
	<strong>29 branches</strong><br />
	In 2014, Ziraat Bank made changes in the design and layout of 29 pilot branches in order to make them more convenient for physically-challenged customers.
	<div class="bg-acikgri" style="margin-top:20px;">As of end-2014 the number of Ziraat Bank domestic branches reached 1,682. The Bank is also mindful of the environmental impact of its efforts to make itself more accessible to its customers.</div>

<p><strong>Addressing the needs of disabled customers</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank designs product and  service formats to make them more convenient for disabled customers to use.</p>
<p>In 2014 Ziraat Bank began making changes in the design and layout of pilot  branches in order to make them more convenient for disabled  customers to use and to bring the branches into compliance with mandatory  criteria concerning the accessibility rights of the physically handicapped that  were introduced in 2013. </p>
<p>Twenty-nine branches are taking part in this pilot program,  which involves the design and integration into Ziraat Bank branch concepts of the  following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interior and exterior flooring surfaces whose textures make them  suitable for the visually impaired</li>
	<li>Call buttons that can be used by the physically-challenged to  summon help when they enter a branch</li>
	<li>Braille-equipped information panels on exterior doors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nine ATM units specially designed so that they can be used  by people suffering from orthopedic difficulties have also been installed in some locations in Ankara and İstanbul. Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s online branch has also  been designed to be usable by visually impaired customers.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank will continue its  efforts to make it easier for the disabled customers to avail themselves of  branch, ATM, and online banking services in the future as well. The Bank&rsquo;s  near-term objectives include extending the scope of changes introduced in pilot  projects to encompass all branches. ATM units will also be altered and equipped  with features that allow the units to be used by the visually impaired as well  as by those with orthopedic difficulties. Work is currently in progress on the  development of spoken menus that will start being added to  ATM units for the benefit of the visually impaired in 2015. The goal is to have  at least one ATM usable by the disabled customers in every city at the outset.</p>
<p>Another plan involves introducing a chat channel by the end  of 2016 in order to enable hearing-impaired customers to benefit from call  center services. Work is also being carried out on making changes in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s mobile banking apps  so as to better accommodate disabled customers&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p><strong>Service network growth: An eco-friendly point of view</strong><br />
As of end-2014 the number of Ziraat Bank domestic branches was  1,682. When expanding the reach of its service network, Ziraat Bank is also mindful of the  environmental impact of its efforts to make itself more accessible to its  customers. For example the number of vehicles allocated for branches&rsquo; use is  minimized so as to help reduce their carbon footprints. </p>
<p>With the introduction of the Bank&rsquo;s New Auditing Model in  2014, it is now possible for an increasingly greater number of the Bank&rsquo;s  branches to be audited from headquarters. Considering that Ziraat Bank has branches based  even in some of Turkey&rsquo;s remotest locations, this practice generates substantial  savings in terms of time, cost, and resource use.</p>
<p>In the medium term, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s goal is to increase the size of its branch network to  2,000 so as to give its customers convenient, quick, and top-quality access to  its financial products and services in every locality.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">As Turkey’s pioneering and leading financial services provider, Ziraat Bank regards contributing to financial literacy by providing consumers with truthful, impartial, comparable, and up-to-date information about financial services as one of its fundamental values. </h2>
<h1>Financial Literacy </h1>
<p>The degree to which a society is financially literate is  tremendously important to its ability to construct a sustainable future for  itself. For individuals, financial literacy means having access to the  information they need in order to make decisions about financial issues that  are vital to their future wellbeing.</p>
<p>As Turkey&rsquo;s pioneering and leading financial services  provider, Ziraat Bank regards contributing  to financial literacy by providing consumers with truthful, impartial,  comparable, and up-to-date information about financial services through every  possible channel and supporting financial literacy through educational  activities as being among its fundamental corporate responsibilities.</p>
Some of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s efforts in this  direction are summarized below.
<ul>
	<li>Ziraat Bank focuses on making  effective use of the internet in order to improve the financial literacy of its  SME customers. To this end, the Bank is currently developing separate internet  websites whose content is structured specifically for the particular needs of  its trade and manufacturing sector customers on the one hand and for its  agricultural sector customers on the other.</li>
	<li>Representatives from Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  Entrepreneurial Banking Department visit branches at regular intervals at which time they  provide branch managers, customer representative officers, and customer  representative assistants with training on financial literacy issues. During  such training, which is informed by the financial particulars of each branch&rsquo;s  non-retail customers, branch employees and customers are given financial  literacy guidance. In 2014 a special seminar on the subject of foreign trade  finance was conducted for the customers of the Bank&rsquo;s branch in the Dudullu Organized Industrial  Zone in İstanbul. </li>
	<li>Ziraat Bank publishes materials and sponsors  activities in support of increasing people&rsquo;s awareness about financial issues.  Such activities include promoting financial products and services in  newspapers, magazines, and other publications and sponsoring TV programs about  economic issues.</li>
	<li>Members of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s senior management regularly  attend economics gatherings as speakers and panelists every year and they are  also interviewed by newspapers and magazines. During such encounters, they use  the platforms and media as an effective way to convey information about  financial literacy to the broadest possible audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial literacy education and training</strong><br />
	During 2014 Ziraat Bank engaged in a variety of education  and training activities aimed at informing consumers about financial product  concepts and use and at making them aware of the various alternatives from  which they were able to choose. Information about these activities and programs  is briefly summarized below.</p>
<p><strong><em>E-learning for children and teenagers</em></strong><br />
The issue of thriftiness, which is  becoming increasingly more important throughout the world nowadays, is a matter  of crucial importance for Ziraat Bank.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank organizes educational activities  for youngsters that help make them aware of the importance of thriftiness and  saving in ways that are both entertaining and informative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ziraat Bank Information Islands&rdquo; is a series of themed  e-learning modules that teach young people about such  things as the relationship between money and banks, how banks function, how to  use borrowing and credit cards wisely, and how to use resources like money,  electricity, and water economically.</p>

<ul>
	<li>&ldquo;Money &amp; Bank Island&rdquo;</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Savings Island&rdquo;</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Borrowing &amp; Credit Card  Island&rdquo;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><em>E-learning for farmers and other customers</em></strong><br />
In keeping with its mission of  supporting agriculture and agricultural endeavors, Ziraat Bank organizes and conducts educational  programs for its farmer customers.</p>
<p>One of these programs deals with  modern irrigation methods and focuses on such matters as proper irrigation  techniques, how to use water resources efficiently, and how to maximize crop  yields and quality.</p>
<p>Another Ziraat Bank program designed for farmers is  concerned with agricultural insurance. This program focuses on the importance  of insurance by making participants aware of the risks they face and how  insurance can help them deal with the losses that such risks can lead to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How Does Credit Card System  Work?&rdquo; is an informative and instructive program designed for Ziraat Bank customers that focuses on the  importance both of credit cards as an essential part of everyday life nowadays  and of using them knowledgeably.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank recently reviewed and revised its  customer e-learning materials for children, teenagers, and farmers in order to  bring the materials up to date in light of recent developments. These revised  materials will go into use in 2015.</p>
