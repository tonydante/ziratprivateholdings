<p class="title">Ziraat Bank and the Environment</p>
<h2>Continuing its efforts to optimize its natural resource use in 2014 with no loss of momentum, Ziraat Bank made significant gains on many fronts.</h2>
<h6>G4-DMA, G4-EN31</h6>
<p>Ziraat Bank engages in an ongoing effort to  make efficient and economical use of the resources such as energy, water,  natural gas, and paper that it consumes in the conduct of its business and  service processes. Under the Sustainability Policy that was announced in 2014,  the Bank has embarked upon a process of creating a new and systematic structure  for its efforts to manage its direct environmental impact.</p>
<p>Some of the projects that the Bank undertook in this area in 2014 are  discussed briefly below.</p>
<h1>Paper Use and Optimization Projects</h1>
<p><strong>Paper  ranks high among the supplies used the most at Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank.</strong><br />
	For Ziraat Bank, recycling and recovering waste  paper to make it economically useful is just as high a priority as is  optimizing its paper consumption.</p>
<p>As of 19 September 2012, Ziraat Bank  stopped using paper for the dispatch of internal communications throughout the  bank. Since then, all such communications have been in electronic format. In  2014 alone this practice prevented the use of 5,764,660 sheets of A4 paper.</p>
<p><strong>Double-sided  hard-copy printouts and e-faxes</strong><br />
	When hard-copy printouts must be taken, the multifunction printers  installed at Ziraat Bank reduce paper consumption by  printing on both sides of the sheet. Besides conserving paper this practice is  also calculated as having reduced the bank&rsquo;s total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by  523 tons in 2014.</p>
<p>Handling about a million fax communications on average every year in the  conduct of its business, in 2014 Ziraat Bank completed its changeover to electronic-format fax transmissions. All of  the Bank&rsquo;s headquarters, regional, and branch units now send, receive, and  archive only electronic-format faxes and no hard-copy printouts of them are  taken. Besides conserving paper, this practice has also increased the security  and accountability of the Bank&rsquo;s fax communication processes.</p>

<strong>3.5 million sheets</strong><br />
It is estimated that Virtual Loan-Account File Project prevented the use of about 3.5 million sheets in 2014 alone. 
<div class="bg-acikgri" style="margin-top:20px;">In 2014 the Centralized Bulk Statement Dispatch Project prevented the use of 12,762,354 sheets of A4 paper.</div>
</h2>

<p><strong>Virtual  Loan-Account File Project</strong><br />
The goal of the Virtual Loan-Account File Project is to handle all  credit and loan-related documentation from creditworthiness investigations and  offers to disbursements and servicing entirely in electronic format both by  scanning paperwork and creating electronic-format documents. When this project  becomes operational, it will also be possible for all involved/authorized units  to access and view this documentation online.</p>
<p>In the first stage of this project, the paper forms formerly used in the  credit proposal/allocation process were prepared in electronic format instead  and without taking hardcopy printouts. The second stage of the project involved  the electronic-format documentation of the credit-rating and proposal processes.  It is expected that this project will substantially reduce Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s use of paper. It is estimated that it prevented the use of about  3.5 million sheets in 2014 alone.</p>
<p>In 2014 efforts continued to be made in the case of documents that the  law requires are obtained from other agencies and organizations when making  credit allocation decisions to get these from their sources in electronic  format as well. Not only will that help such outside concerns in their own  efforts to reduce paper use; for the Bank, it will increase employee motivation  and customer satisfaction by speeding up processing.</p>
<p>In January 2013, the Bank began obtaining electronic-format documents  and information required of firms taking out loans to finance investments. This  also saves paper, labor, time, and space. Documentation used in performing  firms&rsquo; financial analyses is also being circulated among units in electronic  format.</p>
<p>The practice of sending out documents concerning loan applications  approved by Ziraat Bank by mail or fax has been  terminated. These documents are now being transmitted in electronic format  along with the original application appended to them. A centralized retail  credit allocation system encompassing all Ziraat Bank branches became operational as of 12 March 2013.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank is taking part in the Treasury  Undersecretariat&rsquo;s program of converting all bookkeeping records and other  documentation to electronic format. In 2015 the bank&rsquo;s branches will begin  maintaining their daybook and general ledger accounts in electronic format  only. It is expected that this will prevent the use of at least a million  sheets of A4 paper a year.</p>
<p><strong>Substantial  amounts of paper were saved in 2014 thanks to the Centralized Bulk Statement  Dispatch Project.</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank now sends statements of all  transactions performed by its Operations Center to customers by email.</p>
<p>Under the Centralized Bulk Statement Dispatch Project, transaction notes  and statements for transactions which must be so reported as well as for those  which requests are made are sent to customers by email.</p>
<p>In 2014 the Centralized Bulk Statement Dispatch Project prevented the  use of 12,762,354 sheets of A4 paper.</p>
<p><strong>Conserving  paper with electronic-format statements and invoices</strong><br />
	The project that was begun in 2013 to send out electronic-format rather  than paper invoices documenting communication services continued in 2014.  Considering that more than 170,000 telephone bills were handled last year  alone, the huge savings in paper use that result from this procedure may be  appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank is the first and only bank in  Turkey that issues electronic-format mortgage deeds of release.</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank works together with many different  agencies and organizations in order to provide its customers with faster and  better-quality service. One example of this is to be seen in the protocol which  the bank signed with the General Directorate of Deeds &amp; Cadastral Surveys  to permit mortgages on real estate properties to be released electronically.  Under this agreement, mortgage loan borrowers&rsquo; requests for deeds of release  are sent electronically to the Ziraat Bank  Operations Center, which then sends them electronically to the appropriate  deeds registry.</p>
<p>In August 2014 Ziraat Bank  became the first financial institution in Turkey to issue electronic-format  mortgage deeds of release. It is still the only one capable of doing so. The  issuance of electronic-format mortgage deeds of release prevented 2,540 sheets  of A4 paper from being used last year.</p>

<h6>G4-DMA, G4-EN23</h6>


<p><strong>Electronic-format  inspection and internal control reporting saved 174,000 sheets of A4 paper.</strong><br />
Under a project being carried out to issue electronic-format bank  inspection and internal control reports at Ziraat Bank, new auditing and control models have been introduced. All such  reports for branches are now being issued in this way. As a result of this  project, hard-copy reports are no longer being issued for branches and this  practice has generated substantial savings in paper. The audit reports for  headquarters and other units can now be prepared and viewed online. This has  already made it possible to reduce paperwork costs.</p>
<p>The electronic-format preparation, issuance, and circulation of audit  reports by the Ziraat Bank Board of Inspectors and of  internal control reports by the Ziraat Bank  Department of Internal Control &amp; Compliance prevents the use of about  174,000 sheets of A4 paper every year.</p>
<p><strong>E-signature  &amp; Virtual Inspection Archives Project</strong><br />
Under the Board of Auditors&rsquo; E-Signature &amp; Virtual Archives Project,  handwritten signatures are no longer accepted on documents at Ziraat Bank; electronic signatures must be used instead.</p>
<p>Now that the virtual archives project has become operational, all audit  reports and Board of Auditors documentation are being archived digitally. This  practice is generating substantial savings both in paperwork processing costs  and in time. The digital archiving of audit reports has already prevented the  use of about 25,000 sheets of A4 paper. Compared with the cost of maintaining  physical archives, digital archives are also considerably more economical as  well.</p>
<p>Potentially risk-fraught transactions are identified by means of a  variety of scenarios deployed on a daily and monthly basis by the Board of Audittors&rsquo;  Centralized Audit Team. This allows necessary checks to be made through the  system without any physical documentation being required while also increasing  the operational security of the Bank&rsquo;s business and transactions.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">
	<img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/Raporlar/2014/images/icon43.png" class="floatleft" />
	At Ziraat Bank, it is assumed that the project to transfer investigatory processes to the central system will prevent the use of at least 20,000 sheets of A4 paper every year.</h2>


<p><strong>A  project to transfer investigatory processes to the central system will be  completed in 2015.</strong><br />
In 2014 the Board of Auditors initiated a project to incorporate its  investigatory processes into the central system as well. With the completion of  this project, which is expected in early 2015, it will be possible for  investigation reports to be composed, issued, circulated, and viewed online.</p>
<p>The preparation and dissemination of electronic-format rather than  hard-copy investigation reports will generate considerable savings not only in  paper but also in time, cost, and energy. If the investigation reports prepared  in 2014 are taken as a benchmark, this project is likely to prevent the use of  at least 20,000 sheets of A4 paper every year.</p>
<h1>Waste Management</h1>
<p><strong>500  tons of used paper was recycled at Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank  in 2014.</strong><br />
	Since 2003, documents whose retention by Ziraat Bank is no longer mandated by law together with the waste paper that the  Bank&rsquo;s units and branches generate has been sold to licensed firms for use in  recycling.</p>
<p>In this way, the Bank helps reduce the amounts of new raw materials  needed in paper manufacturing.</p>
<p>In 2014 a total of 192 tons of waste paper generated by headquarters  units was disposed of in this way. Another 500 tons generated by the Bank&rsquo;s  branches was sold under contract to two licensed recycling firms.</p>
<p>The process of reducing paper use in the conduct of the Bank&rsquo;s  operations continues. In 2014 the Bank purchased 1,915 tons of paper, of which  775 tons (290,000 packs) consisted of A4 and 1,140 tons consisted of untrimmed  raw paper.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">During 2014, nine of the Ziraat Bank’s service buildings underwent controlled demolition and their materials were recovered. The Bank has set itself a target of increasing the number of its sustainability-friendly branches to 400 in 2015.</h2>

<h6>G4-DMA, G4-EN23, G4-EN27, G4-EN31</h6>

<p><strong>IT and  other electrical and electronic scrap</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank sells discarded IT equipment (computers, printers,  photocopiers, etc), equipment consisting largely of sheet metal (air  conditioner units, housings, etc), storage batteries, and ATM units to  environment ministry-licensed firms authorized to transport and process such  scrap. This prevents the scrap from causing environmental harm while also  ensuring that it is recycled for use as inputs by others.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical  waste</strong><br />
	When replacing the chemicals in fire extinguishers that have passed  their expiration date, Ziraat Bank works with firms licensed to collect and  dispose of such materials. By working only with duly supervised and authorized  firms, the Bank ensures that the chemicals are properly disposed of without causing  environmental harm.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction  of spent toner cartridges</strong><br />
	As required by the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Regulation on the control of electrical and electronic equipment waste&rdquo;  published in issue 28300 of the official gazette on 22 May 2012, Ziraat Bank has begun surrendering its branches&rsquo;  spent toner cartridges for destruction by their original manufacturers.</p>
<h1>Improvements in Ziraat Bank  Service Premises</h1>
<p>In keeping with its environmental protection approach, Ziraat Bank seeks to constantly improve the eco-friendliness of all aspects of  its branch network and other service premises.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank takes an R&amp;D approach when identifying the plumbing,  electrical components, fittings, furniture, furnishings and similar inputs that  it uses in its own construction projects. Attention is given to the  functionality and recyclability of such materials and preference is given to  concepts whose environmental impact is potentially the least.</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to minimize the environmental impact of its  construction projects, Ziraat Bank  has waste generated during the conduct of work transferred under supervision to  locations designated by local municipal authorities. In all such undertakings,  efforts are made to contribute beneficially to the environment through  effective supervision that ensures that waste is properly removed from building  sites.</p>
<p><strong>In  2014, 274 Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank  branches were rehabilitated in light of sustainability criteria.</strong><br />
	In keeping with its efforts to expand the scope of sustainability  concepts throughout the Bank, alterations were carried out at 274 of the Bank&rsquo;s  branches. In the project design and application stages, precedence was given to  the use of innovative, composite materials which transcended classical criteria  and whose environmental impact was considered as well. In the case of  structures that are likely eventually to be demolished, attention is given as  early as the project-costing stage to the recovery and reuse of materials.</p>
<p>In architectural design, attention is given to projects that make use of  natural daylight, potentially eco-harmful materials are avoided, and precedence  is given to applications that will quickly pay for themselves within two years  or so.</p>
<p>During 2014, nine of the Bank&rsquo;s service buildings underwent controlled  demolition and their materials were recovered. The Bank has set itself a target  of increasing the number of its sustainability-friendly branches to 400 in  2015.</p>

	One of the goals of Ziraat Bank Data Centers renovation project is to reduce the Bank’s annual energy consumption to around 4,226,700 kWh.
	
	
	
	</h2>


<h6>G4-DMA, G4-EN6, G4-EN7</h6>

<h1>Initiatives to Reduce Energy Use</h1>
<p>During 2014 Ziraat Bank continued to work on a large  number of projects aimed at reducing its energy use.</p>
<p><strong>The  Ziraat Bank Data Centers Project</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank is in the process of reorganizing its data centers in light  of its current needs.</p>

<h6>G4-DMA, G4-EN6, G4-EN7, G4-EN27, G4-EN31</h6>

<p>The Ziraat Bank Data Centers Project has a twofold  IT focus that concentrates separately on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the organizations to which services are provided (Ziraat Bank, Ziraat Katılım  credit union,  Ziraat Sigorta, Ziraat Emeklilik, etc)</li>
	<li>the diversity of the services being provided (online banking, ATM  network access, credit cards, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the design, construction, installation, and relocation of data  centers, attention is to be given to the interactions among all of these  services.</p>
<p>The gains that will be achieved through the Ziraat Bank Data Centers  Project may be summed up as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Risk management functions will be improved by the changeover to  technology that is newer and more secure.</li>
	<li>A higher level of performance will be achieved.</li>
	<li>Less energy will be consumed.</li>
	<li>The overall structure&rsquo;s modularity will make more flexible and  expandable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Data Centers are currently  operating with infrastructure which has been in service for more than a decade  and which consumes about 6,570,000 kWh of electricity a year on average. One of  the goals of these centers&rsquo; renovation is to reduce their average annual energy  consumption to around 4,226,700 kWh.</p>
<p>This estimated 2,343,300 kWh reduction in energy use should generate  cost savings on the order of USD&nbsp;300 thousand a year.</p>
<p><strong>Green  IT Project</strong><br />
One of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s sustainability priorities is to  conserve energy by making more efficient use of energy resources.</p>
<p>The Green IT project that Ziraat Bank  first initiated in 2005 to optimize the energy use of the computers employed in  its branch, regional, and headquarters units has been continuing successfully  ever since.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If computers at the Bank remain on outside normal office hours, their users  are messaged notices at specified times advising them to shut down their  machines. Units will automatically shut down unless the user takes action to  prevent it.</li>
	<li>When computers at Ziraat Bank  remain idle for 10 minutes, their monitors automatically go into sleep mode in  order to help conserve energy.</li>
	<li>Microsoft&rsquo;s System Center 2012 Configuration Manager systems management  software opens in vPro mode outside of office hours, on weekends, and in the  event of an emergency so that security patches and updates may be installed  more efficiently.</li>
	<li>Hardware failures can be detected and identified centrally even if the  remote operating system is not functioning. This speeds up the intervention and  repair process by ensuring that technicians show up with the spare parts etc  that they need.</li>
</ul>
<p>The savings generated by the automatic shutdown of the Bank&rsquo;s computers when  they are not actively being used and adherence to other Green IT policies and  practices are put at about TL&nbsp;5 million a year. The benefits of Green IT  to Ziraat Bank consist of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enhanced productivity</li>
	<li>Lower operating costs</li>
	<li>Improved customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E-signatures  in tendering processes</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank has adopted the use of  e-signatures in its tendering processes in order to save on time as well as on  the fuel and paper that would otherwise be used by/for personnel and travel.  This helps minimize the use of expendables in the conduct of tendering  procedures, averts the environmental harm such use might cause, and also  permits labor and time to be used for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized  spot-checks</strong><br />
Performed by the Ziraat Bank  Centralized Spot-Check Team, centralized spot-checks are a method of randomly  checking ordinary transactions according to different scenarios at  predetermined intervals.</p>
<p>Centralized spot checks are performed by the team online and without any  physical documentation being required. The results of these checks are reported  in the same way. This saves time, expense, and energy while also eliminating  the need for paper.</p>
<p><strong>Instant  controls</strong><br />
	An Instant Control Project is to be undertaken that will allow internal  controllers to check branches&rsquo; transactions the moment they take place.  Whenever a branch transaction crosses a specific risk threshold, it will be  examined immediately by the Instant Control Team. If the transaction is  determined to be in error, the branch will be notified immediately so that it  can be corrected the same day. Besides reducing the costs incurred by  inadvertencies, this project will also save on time, energy, and paper use.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel-consumption  criteria in vehicle procurements</strong><br />
	Another way in which Ziraat Bank  seeks to minimize the adverse environmental impact of its operations is the  attention that it gives to fuel-consumption criteria when purchasing or leasing  vehicles. The fuel that vehicles being considered for purchase or rental  require is treated as an element of total cost of ownership while fuel economy  is included as one of the criteria of tendering specifications. Besides  lowering the vehicles&rsquo; environmental impact, this practice also incidentally  reduces total fossil fuel consumption at the national level.</p>
<p><strong>Changeover  to LED illumination</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank seeks to conserve energy as much  as possible in the conduct of its service operations. The Bank reduces its  illumination costs by installing more energy-efficient LED lighting systems in  its branches, signage, and ATM housings. Ziraat Bank is also minimizing its use of fluorescent lighting owing to the  human and environmental health and safety issues that it poses.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank completed its changeover to a new  WAN structure in 2014.</strong><br />
	A project to convert all branch data lines to a new WAN (wide area  network) structure was completed in 2014. Under this project, data transfer  speeds were increased and cabling was also simplified without the need for new  hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized  monitoring of ATM units</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank owns and operates an extensive ATM  network. A project to monitor these units centrally and also to equip them with  biometric access-control features that is currently in progress is slated for  completion in February 2016.</p>
<p>With the completion of this project, it will also be possible to  centrally monitor ATM housings&rsquo; ambient temperatures and energy use. By  collecting and analyzing such data, energy use can be reduced by making  fine-tuned adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank achieves substantial savings in  time, cost, and resource use through the centralized inspection of its  branches.</strong><br />
With the commissioning of the New Auditing Model at Ziraat Bank in 2014, it has become possible to perform inspections on a number  of small-scale branches based on an analysis of their year-long risk exposure  directly from headquarters and without having to actually visit a branch&rsquo;s  physical premises. This achieves significant savings in terms of time, cost,  and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying  risky transactions by the Inspection Scenario Team saves time, cost, and  energy.</strong><br />
	Scenarios have been composed for use by the Inspection Scenario Team to  identify transactions that are incompatible with Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate risk attitudes. These scenarios enable the team&rsquo;s  members to spot potential risks among thousands of transactions</p>
<p>By enabling Bank inspectors to focus their attentions on such risks,  this practice achieves significant savings in terms of time, cost, and energy.<strong></strong></p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">
	<strong>TL 5 million</strong><br />
	The savings generated by the automatic shutdown of the Bank’s computers and adherence to other Green IT policies are put at about TL 5 million a year.

<p><strong>Environmental  impact mitigation</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>In 2014 Ziraat Bank procured 1,956 split air conditioners equipped with high energy-efficiency inverter  technology and non-ozone-depleting R-410A refrigerant.</li>
	<li>Of these units, 256 that the Bank procured to help reduce its heating  costs and improve its energy efficiency comply with the newly-introduced  Variable Refrigerant Flow/Volume (VRF/VRV) standard that reduces energy use  while also maximizing comfort.</li>
	<li>The specifications for Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s procurements of the cleaning  materials used by its branches and units stipulate that they must be  manufactured from chemicals that are not harmful to either human or  environmental health. Although the cleaning equipment (vacuum cleaners, mops,  floor polishers, etc) and the cleaning supplies (detergents, soaps, polishes,  disinfectants, etc) used to clean service buildings are procured by outside  cleaning service providers, their compliance with specifications is periodically  checked by the Bank.</li>
	<li>In line with its efforts to reduce the adverse environmental impact of  its personnel transportation services, Ziraat Bank has begun using routing  software that shortens travel distances and thus saves fuel. The Ankara phase  of this project, which seeks both to maximize service quality and to minimize  cost, was completed in 2014. The Bank plans to undertake the same project in İstanbul and İzmir in 2015.</li>

<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank&rsquo;s indirect environmental impact</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s indirect environmental impact  manifests itself in its product and service presentation processes.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank provides financing support to a wide range of undertakings,  especially in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, which are  capable of playing a key role in combating environmental degradation and  climate change. For the same purpose, the Bank also supplies high added-value  products and services to tens of thousands of individuals and SMEs that are  active in agriculture and many other business lines all over Turkey.</p>
<p>More detailed information about the Bank&rsquo;s activities under this heading  during the reporting period is given in the &ldquo;Customers&rdquo; section beginning on  page 50 of this report.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">

	Ziraat Bank gives particular importance to supporting projects which will generate added value for the national economy. In this respect, the Bank supports energy sector. The ratio of the energy sector loans in Ziraat Bank’s corporate lending portfolio is 6%, with outstanding balance of TL 7.5 billion.

<p><strong>More  effective indirect environmental impact management through sectoral  specialization</strong><br />
Believing in the value and importance of sectoral specialization and in  keeping with its corporate strategies, Ziraat Bank has begun more effectively managing the indirect impact that its  products and services have on the environment and on climate change. The Bank  has set up organizational units that specialize in manufacturing, construction,  agriculture, and energy project investments. This makes it possible for the Bank  to keep a much closer watch on sector-specific issues such as technology,  changes in the legal framework, and investment tax incentives and thus to  propose potent value-creation solutions to its customers. </p>
<p><strong>The  importance of the energy sector and its contribution to Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank&rsquo;s loan portfolio</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank gives particular importance to  supporting sectors and projects which are capable of generating added value for  the national economy while also reducing the country&rsquo;s foreign dependency,  especially in the case of energy.</p>
<p>Keeping Turkey supplied with the energy it needs currently accounts for  some 60% of the country&rsquo;s foreign trade deficit. Investments in the energy  sector will therefore not only help reduce that deficit but will also ensure  that energy is available when and where it is required.</p>
<p>According to 31 December 2014 figures published by the Banking  Regulation and Supervision Agency, Ziraat Bank  accounted for a 7.7% share of all the lendings made to the Turkish energy  sector.</p>
<p>As of the same date, the outstanding balance of the energy sector loans  in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate lending portfolio  amounted to TL&nbsp;7.5 billion or about 6% of the total. An analysis shows  that TL&nbsp;4.1 billion consisted of cash loans while the remaining  TL&nbsp;3.4 billion reflected the Bank&rsquo;s non-cash credit exposure.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank provides financing support to  energy projects based on its assessment of the nature, terms, and merits of the investment. The Bank also serves as a  conduit for funding made available for such projects by international financial  institutions such as the World Bank. For more detailed information, please <a href="m-3-2.html">click here.</a></p>
<p>Electronic-format documentation concerning Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s energy sector financing activities, including the outcomes of  reporting processes and detailed analyses of sectorally-important issues is  accessible to internal stakeholders through the bank&rsquo;s online portal.</p>
<p>In order to improve Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  ability to identify and meet the funding needs of the energy sector, bank  personnel take part in training on a variety of energy-related issues that is  provided by external consultants.</p>
<p><strong>Ziraat</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Bank will remain steadfast in its  commitment to protecting the environment.</strong><br />
	Behaving as a responsible corporate citizen and abiding by the  principles and goals set out in its Sustainability Policy, Ziraat Bank will remain steadfast in its commitment to protect the environment  in 2015 and the years that follow. Among its efforts to enhance the  environmental added value that it creates, the Bank plans to have Leadership in  Energy &amp; Environmental Design (LEED) certification obtained for the Ziraat  Towers project that is being built at the International Financial Center  Complex in İstanbul&rsquo;s Ataşehir district.</p>
