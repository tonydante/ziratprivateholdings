<p class="title">2014 Prioritization Analysis</p>

<h2>During the preparation of its 2014 sustainability report, Ziraat Bank realized a detailed evaluation process in compliance with GRI G4.</h2>

<h6>G4-18</h6>
<p>For the  preparation of its 2014 sustainability report, Ziraat Bank made changes in its  prioritization analysis approach so as to make it compatible with GRI G4  reporting principles.</p>
<p>The focal  point of this prioritization was to identify the economic, environmental, and  social topics that are of the greatest concern both to the bank and to its  internal and external stakeholders.</p>
<h1>Identifying material topics</h1>
<p>In the  process of identifying the elements that would be cited in the conduct of the  priority analysis, attention was given both to Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s own activities and  their impact and to shareholder expectations. For this purpose, GRI-published  principles pertaining to the nature and content of reports were adhered to.</p>
<p>In the  process of determining material topics, Ziraat Bank made use of:</p>
<ol>
	<li>comprehensive  surveys conducted among the Bank&rsquo;s unit managers and personnel (its internal  stakeholders),</li>
	<li>analyses of  feedback received from external stakeholders through a variety of channels  throughout 2014,</li>
	<li>conclusions  drawn from discussions with international financial institutions and rating  agencies,</li>
	<li>the results  of desk-based work carried out by the Ziraat Bank Sustainability Project Team.</li>
</ol>
<p>Internal  stakeholders&rsquo; views were determined by means of a comprehensive survey  conducted among the Bank&rsquo;s unit managers and personnel.</p>
<h6>G4-26</h6>
<p>The views of  external stakeholders (customers, suppliers, international agencies and  organizations, etc) were taken up at meetings with representatives of the Bank  units that are in regular communication with such groups. During these  meetings, the findings of items 2 and 3 in the list above were discussed and  stakeholder priorities were ascertained accordingly.</p>
<p>Having thus  been identified based on information drawn from a variety of sources, these  priorities were then considered in light of GRI G4 criteria and the  bank-internal and bank-external impacts of each one were determined.</p>
<h6>G4-19</h6>
<p>As a result  of this prioritization analysis, topics that Ziraat Bank and its stakeholders  deemed to have material relevance were identified and ranked in order of their  significance to them. This information was then used as input for the creation  of the 2014 Ziraat Bank Priority Matrix.</p>
<h1>Ziraat Bank 2014 sustainability priorities (matrix)<br />
	<br />
</h1>
<p><img src="https://www.ziraatbank.com.tr/SitePages/Raporlar/2014/images/i1eng.png" /></p>

<h2 class="sag cizgi">All of the topics identified as a result of the 2014 prioritization analysis have direct and close impact on both Ziraat Bank’s business lines and its external stakeholders.</h2>
<h1>Validation</h1>
<p>Validation  of the prioritization analysis and subsequent processes was carried out by the  sustainability project team.</p>
<h1>Material topic framework</h1>
<h6>G4-20, G4-21</h6>
<p>All of the  material topics identified as a result of the 2014 prioritization analysis have  significance for and impact strongly on both Ziraat Bank and its stakeholders.  These material topics may be assigned to one of three categories indicative of  the degree of their significance and impact.</p>
<p>The topics  in the first category are the most important issues affecting Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s  current and future performance. These consist of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>market- and  customer-focus, banking product and service range diversity, customer  satisfaction, brand value and international reputation enhancement, extensive  geographical reach and customer accessibility, diversified deposit base,</li>
	<li>support for  agriculture as embodied in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s mission, provision of services to the  SMEs and entrepreneurs who are so important to the national economy,</li>
	<li>safeguarding  customer data,</li>
	<li>effective  corporate governance and risk management in a manner that also embraces  sustainability management.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these  topics are of direct and immediate concern, without exception, to all of the  bank&rsquo;s business lines, to the members of the Ziraat Finance Group (even though  they are not covered by this report), to Ziraat Bank employees, and to all  other external stakeholders.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank  is a financial services provider that is also the center of the most extensive  bank branch network in Turkey. According to 2014 figures, there were more than  400 towns and villages in Turkey in which Ziraat Bank was the only financial  services provider with a physical presence. This unrivaled geographical reach  is what determines the bank&rsquo;s position in the Turkish economy; it also shows  how important and influential the material topics of the first category are to  the country&rsquo;s economic and social development. All these topics will  additionally be crucial to the added value that can be generated and shared in  the short, medium, and long terms.</p>
<p>The topics  in the second and third categories are issues whose significance and priority  may vary from one stakeholder to another. Examples of these include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A high priority issue for Ziraat Bank is the services that we provide to the SMEs and entrepreneurs, all of which are of the utmost importance to the Turkish economy.</li>
	<li>New  investment in IT infrastructure and alternative delivery channels: While this  is extremely important for Ziraat Bank and its customers, other external stakeholders  deem it to be of low priority.</li>
	<li>Employee  participation, employee welfare, employee training &amp; development, employee  remuneration, etc: While such issues are significant to personnel, who make up  one of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s most important stakeholder groups, they are of relatively  less importance among external stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<h6>G4-23</h6>
<p>While there  were no changes in Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s operational framework during the reporting  period, this report is the first time that Ziraat Bank has formally defined a  material topic framework and publicly disclosed it.</p>

<h1>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s stakeholders</h1>
<p>Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s primary stakeholder group consists of its shareholder, employees,  customers, and suppliers. The bank engages in interactive communication with  the members of this group in the conduct of its activities. Because the largest  part of this stakeholder communication takes place in the conduct of day-to-day  operations, it provides an extremely important way for the bank to correctly  understand and assess stakeholders&rsquo; wishes and expectations.</p>
<p>In addition  to this primary stakeholder group, there is a secondary tier of stakeholders  with which Ziraat Bank engages closely. The members of this group consist of  regulatory authorities, international financial institutions, investors, rating  agencies, media concerns, professional and industry associations and  organizations and society at large.</p>
