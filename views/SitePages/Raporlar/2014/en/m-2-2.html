<h1>The sustainability of one&rsquo;s successful performance is achievable only if  confidence-building cooperation among stakeholders is cultivated and  maintained.</h1>
<p>By fostering  the climate of teamwork that is essential for improving one&rsquo;s competitive  strength, corporate governance encourages active cooperation among all  stakeholders and thus helps progress towards their planned objectives.</p>
<p>Scrupulously  mindful of corporate governance principles both during and subsequent to the  conduct of any operation, Ziraat Bank strives to meet the expectations of all  of its stakeholders and to achieve a sustainable performance in line with that  approach.</p>
<p>In all  matters pertaining to corporate governance, Ziraat Bank focuses on the four  fundamental principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, and  responsibility. The bank provides for performance-enhancing mechanisms by  engaging its stakeholders in its decision-making processes.</p>

<h1>Internal audit, internal control, and risk management</h1>
<p>Internal audit, internal control, and risk management activities at  Ziraat Bank are performed by the Board of Auditors,  the Internal Control and Compliance Department, and the Risk Management  Department. These units&rsquo; duties and responsibilities, which are segregated from  one another, are coordinated by the Assistant General Manager Office for  Internal Systems.</p>
<p>This organization is structured so as to embrace all Bank units and  branches as well as Bank-owned subsidiaries subject to the Bank&rsquo;s oversight.  Its purpose is to minimize any risks that might adversely affect the  thoroughgoing and secure conduct of banking operations, the fulfillment of  long-term profit targets, the reliability of financial and administrative  reporting, and/or the Bank&rsquo;s reputation and financial stability.</p>
<p><strong>Internal  audit system</strong><br />
	The Board of Auditors takes a risk-focused approach in the fulfillment  of its responsibilities to ensure that the activities and operations of the Bank&rsquo;s  headquarters units, domestic and international branches, and subsidiaries are  compliant with the requirements of laws and regulations and are compatible with  the Bank&rsquo;s own strategies, policies, principles, and objectives. The board  conducts its activities in such a way as both to keep the Bank&rsquo;s senior  management informed and to contribute to their decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The Board of Auditors has 184 bank inspectors on its staff. The board  conducts its activities in line with internationally-accepted internal auditing  standards. Besides checking the Bank&rsquo;s operations for their compliance with  statutorily mandated procedures, in 2014 the board also reviewed and assessed  the effectiveness and efficiency of the transaction procedures involved in both  primary and secondary processes. In addition, processes governed by Banking Regulation  and Supervision Agency (BRSA) regulations pertaining to information systems and  banking processes were also audited by information technology inspectors in  line with the Bank&rsquo;s own practices.</p>

<strong>244 branches</strong><br />
During 2014, 244 of the Bank’s branches were centrally inspected by a Central Inspection Team.

</h2>


<h6>G4-DMA, G4-14</h6>

<p>Activities taking place within the Board of Auditors in 2014 are  summarized below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Central Audit Team continued its intensive operations in 2014 by  performing scenario analyses which not only identify irregularities that may  have occurred but which also are influential in preventing potential ones from  being committed.</li>
	<li>The R&amp;D Team kept a close watch on the business processes of the  Board of Auditors and of all other Bank units, engaged in activities to make  necessary revisions in such processes and their rules, examined completed audit  reports and advised appropriate units of its findings when this was deemed to  be necessary, and kept abreast both of current statutory and regulatory  requirements and of changes proposed by senior management and headquarters  units in order to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of control points.</li>
	<li>A Scenario Team has been set up and charged with formulating scenarios  both to identify shortcomings in Bank processes and to develop and improve the  effectiveness of such processes, with implementing these scenarios, and with  devising speedy and effective solutions for dealing with them throughout the Bank.  In 2014 the results of this team&rsquo;s activities that were made available for use  by other units of the Bank led to the taking of much beneficial action.</li>
	<li>A Central Inspection Team that was set up to increase the frequency and  effectiveness of inspections by constantly and centrally monitoring designated  branch groups has commenced operations. During 2014, 244 of the Bank&rsquo;s branches  were centrally inspected by this team in accordance with the same criteria  employed for on-site inspections.</li>
	<li>The Management Statement, a practice which was introduced in 2011 and  which involves giving assurances concerning the effectiveness, adequacy, and  conformity of internal controls over information systems and banking processes,  was submitted to the Bank&rsquo;s external auditors in January 2014. In these  statements, the Board of Directors assesses the effectiveness, adequacy, and  conformity of internal controls performed on the Bank&rsquo;s information systems and  banking processes during the conduct of information system audits and it  declares that such audits accurately reflect the Bank&rsquo;s operations and the  current situation.</li>
	<li>An information systems and banking processes auditing handbook has been  composed in compliance with the requirements of Regulation on Bank Information System  and Banking Process Audits to be conducted by independent auditing firms, which  was published in issue 27461 of Official Gazette dated 13 January 2010.</li>
	<li>Branch Riskiness Study: As a result of activities conducted within the  Board of Auditors in order to rank branches according to their riskiness,  specific criteria have been identified that allow branches to be assigned  points according to their risk exposures during particular periods of time.  This allows risky branches to be spotted so that priority may be given to them  when planning inspections.</li>
	<li>Under the Bank&rsquo;s Virtual Archives Project, every inspector has been  assigned an electronic signature for use on reports. So-called &ldquo;wet&rdquo; (<em>ie</em> handwritten) signatures on such  reports are no longer accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspectors are given the opportunity to constantly improve their professional knowledge and experience by conducting inspections at different Bank units from time to time. They also continued to be provided with training on personal and professional issues at regular intervals during 2014.</p>
<p>The practice of recruiting qualified human resources for the Bank’s administrative staff by allowing inspectors to transfer to such positions continues. Fifty-four new assistant inspectors were also recruited and hired by the Bank in 2014.</p>
<p>Along with the inauguration of the Operations Center and following the Board of Auditors’ assessment of systematic changes arising from revisions in the Bank’s organizational structure, from new modules added to lending decision-making processes, and from centralized credit allocation structures, a new auditing model incorporating all business processes was put into use. The results of inspections are now being made available for all Bank units to use.</p>
<p>Under a newly-introduced Findings Follow-Up Mechanism, issues that are identified during inspections are no longer just reported; attention is now also being given to the need to eliminate or correct, within a designated period of time, whatever shortcomings and errors are at issue.</p>
<p>In keeping with its strong sense of responsibility and awareness of its duties, the Board of Auditors will continue to execute the internal auditing plan in line with goals and policies set forth by the Bank’s senior management and within the framework of current auditing approaches, to report its findings to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee, and to monitor measures that are taken on the basis of the findings.</p>

<h2 class="sag cizgi">Internal control activities are conducted so as to be compatible with the Bank’s primary objectives and strategies from the standpoint of their scope and methodology.</h2>

<p><strong>Internal  control and compliance system</strong><br />
Internal control activities are structured so as to embrace the  operations of all headquarters units and of all domestic and international  branches as required by &ldquo;Regulation on Bank Internal System and Intrinsic  Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes&rdquo;. Such activities are constantly reviewed  and revised in line with the Bank&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>While internal control activities are conducted so as to be compatible  with the Bank&rsquo;s primary objectives and strategies from the standpoint of their  scope and methodology, a proactive approach has been adopted in order to more  readily accommodate changes in strategies and conditions arising from altered  risk perceptions and from the changeover to a new service model. To this end, the  Bank formulated and put into effect its New Control Model. The goal of this  more proactive structure is to help ensure that Bank&rsquo;s operations exceed  sectoral norms and that they are conducted in a manner that is compatible with  both internal and external regulations as well  as with the demands of competition.</p>
<p>Domestic branch checks are performed both on location and centrally  within the framework of a program that is prepared taking into account  branches&rsquo; current levels of risk exposure.</p>
<p>Internal control operations at all branches located outside Turkey are  carried out in line with control programs that are prepared for each year.</p>
<p>Headquarters unit control cycles are determined taking into account  their functions, potential risks, terms of reference, and impact on the Bank&rsquo;s  balance sheet. These cycles are revised as needs may require.</p>
<p>The findings ascertained as a result of all of these activities are  compiled under specific headings in reports that are circulated among  appropriate units and the members of senior management.</p>
<p>In the case of issues which are identified during internal control  activities and which are deemed to be in need of more detailed attention, a  preliminary examination is performed by internal control personnel on location.  This practice continued in 2014 as well. Based on the reports of such  preliminary examinations, appropriate action was taken by the Bank in a timely  manner. Instances of suspected misconduct were reported to the Board of Auditors  so that a full examination/investigation could be conducted as circumstances  warranted.</p>
<p>In addition to such matters, compliance reviews were also carried out by internal control personnel as required by article 18 of “Regulation on Bank Internal System and Intrinsic Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes”. In the course of such reviews, all operations conducted or planned by the Bank as well as new transactions and products are checked to be sure that they comply with laws and regulations, with the Bank’s own policies and rules, and with commonly accepted banking practices. During these compliance reviews, existing bank-internal rules and proposed changes in them are also examined and views concerning them are circulated among appropriate units.</p>
<p>Besides their conduct of internal control functions, internal control personnel also continued to prepare and issue reports containing suggestions of ways to improve existing processes at the Bank and to mitigate the risks inherent in them. The objective of this practice is to preclude risks by spotting them in advance, to make the Bank more competitive by improving its business processes, and to increase customer satisfaction while also taking measures to cut costs.</p>
<p>The practice of recruiting qualified human resources for the Bank’s administrative staff by allowing internal control personnel to transfer to such positions continued.</p>
<h2 class="sag cizgi">Ziraat Bank’s approach to risk management is rooted in fostering a risk culture throughout the entire Bank and in keeping its risk management functions at the “best practices” level.</h2>

<p><strong>Risk management system</strong><br />
	Ziraat Bank’s approach to risk management is rooted in fostering a risk culture throughout the entire Bank that is compatible with the requirements of Regulation on Bank Internal System and Intrinsic Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes and in keeping its risk management functions at the “best practices” level by constantly improving both its systems and its human resources.</p>
<p>Care is given to ensure that all risk management system activities are coordinated through the involved participation of the operational branches with which each type of risk is associated. The principal risk categories are defined as “Credit Risk”, “Market Risk”, “Operational Risk”, and “Balance Sheet Risks”. The last category includes the interest rate risks and liquidity risks to which the Bank is exposed on account of its banking operations. A fundamental goal of all risk management is to abide by internationally recognized best practices.</p>
<p>Under the heading of credit risk management, Basel III-compatible methods are used to define, measure, monitor, and report credit risk. The Bank has been calculating its core credit risk exposure and reporting it monthly on the basis of its solo and consolidated accounts to BRSA ever since this practice was mandated by law as of 1 July 2012.</p>
<p>Under the heading of measuring creditworthiness using advanced quantification methods, work is currently being carried out at the Bank based on the results generated by applying scoring models to different loan portfolios. Statistical methods are employed to confirm both the validity of these rating models and to quantify the effectiveness of their performance. Credit risk limits approved by the Board of Directors are also monitored while scenario analyses and stress tests are carried out based on non-performing loan ratios.</p>
<p>Under the heading of operational risk management, the operational risks to which the Bank is exposed are defined, classified, measured, and analyzed. The results of such analyses are supported by means of stress tests. Such operational risk limits as may be approved by the Board of Directors are also monitored at regular intervals. The operational risk loss database in the Finart environment allows incidents of operational risk to be tracked. Information technology risks and associated actions are followed up. Risk exposure assessments are conducted for companies providing outsourced support services as required by current BRSA regulations.</p>
<p>Under the heading of market risk and balance sheet risk management, market, liquidity, and interest rate risks arising from banking accounts are measured, analyzed, delimited, reported, and monitored. Analyses are also supported by means of stress tests. Such market risk and liquidity risk limits as may be approved by the Board of Directors are also monitored at regular intervals. A “Liquidity Coverage Ratio” is now being calculated as per BRSA regulations published in line with Basel III criteria. This ratio is also reported to BRSA every week on a solo and every month on a consolidated basis. In the case of market risk, backtest analyses are performed for the bank-internal models that are used.</p>
