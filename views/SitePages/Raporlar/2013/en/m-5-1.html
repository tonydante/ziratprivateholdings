<div class="dartext">
	<p class="hilite">Ziraat Bank gives great importance to complying with the law, to transparency, to ethical conduct, and to accountability and it carries out all of its operations in line with such principles.</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank believes that full compliance with corporate  governance rules and laws is what guarantees sustainable economic performance  and ethical and fair competition and that this is the most fundamental means of  balancing and developing stakeholders&rsquo; interests.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>For Ziraat Bank, how goals are achieved is just as important as  achieving the goals themselves.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Every Ziraat employee is expected to be mindful of the law and to  act ethically and honestly in every decision that is taken and in every action  that is performed in the Bank&rsquo;s name. This simple rule is equally applicable to  everyone from members of the Board of Directors to junior clerks on duty in  Turkey&rsquo;s remotest town.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate governance structure</strong><br />
The Ziraat Bank Board of  Directors consists of nine members. This number is deemed to be sufficient to  permit the effective organization and conduct of the board&rsquo;s activities.  The&nbsp;duties of board chairman and of bank general manager are performed by  different individuals.</p>
<p>For information about the  members of the Ziraat Bank Board of Directors, please see pages 64-67 of the  Bank&rsquo;s 2013 annual report.</p>
<p>The general manager has  full authority and responsibility for the management and coordination of Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s day-to-day business in the broadest sense. The&nbsp;Bank has ten assistant  general managers, each one of whom is responsible for the conduct of designated  duties. Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s senior management consists of its general manager and its  assistant general managers.</p>

	<p>For information about the  members of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s senior management, please see pages 68-71 of the  Bank&rsquo;s 2013 annual report.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank is a  state-owned bank. There are no ultimate controlling shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>There are four committees charged with specific activities at  Ziraat Bank.</strong><br />
These four committees,  which have been set up by Ziraat Bank in accordance with the requirements of  the Turkish Commercial Code, the Banking Act, and other applicable laws,  regulations, and administrative provisions, consist of the Credit Committee,  the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, and the Remuneration  Committee. The&nbsp;Board of Directors is authorized to set up other committees  if needed or if deemed to be necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Internal audit, internal control, and risk management at Ziraat  Bank</strong><br />
Internal audit, internal  control, and risk management functions at Ziraat Bank are carried out by the  Board of Inspectors and by the Internal Control and Risk Management Group.  Although these two bodies work in coordination, their duties, responsibilities,  and organizational structures are completely independent of each other. Their  purview encompasses all bank branches and units as well as subsidiaries and  affiliates that are subject to the Bank&rsquo;s oversight with the aims of ensuring  that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Banking activities are conducted precisely and securely</li>
  <li>Long-term profitability targets are fulfilled</li>
  <li>Financial and administrative reporting is reliable</li>
  <li>The effects of risks capable of adversely impacting on the  Bank&rsquo;s reputation and financial stability are minimized.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Board of  Inspectors employs a staff of 167 bank inspectors to carry out its operations  in line with internationally accepted internal auditing standards.</p>
<p>Internal control  functions at Ziraat Bank are structured in such a way as to encompass the  activities of all domestic and international branches, regional departments,  and headquarters units as required by government regulations governing banks&rsquo;  internal systems.</p>
<p>Internal control  functions at all the Bank&rsquo;s foreign branches are carried out in line with  annual internal control plans that are approved by the Audit Committee.</p>
<p>The compliance oversight  functions mandated under article 18 of Regulations Concerning The Internal  Systems Of Banks are also carried out as part of internal control, at which  time all activities carried out or planned by the Bank and new banking  transactions and products are reviewed to determine that they are in compliance  with applicable laws, regulations, and administrative provisions, with the  Bank&rsquo;s internal policies and rules, and with generally-accepted banking  practices.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management at Ziraat Bank</strong><br />
In the conduct of its  risk management activities, Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s fundamental approach is to foster a  risk culture throughout the Bank and to ensure that risk management functions  are as close as possible to best practices by making ongoing improvements in  both systems and human resources quality.</p>
<p>Risk management  activities are conducted under the main headings of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Credit risk, </li>
  <li>Market risk, </li>
  <li>Operational risk and </li>
  <li>Balance sheet risk (interest rate risks and liquidity risks  incurred on bank accounts).</li>
</ul>
<p>The ultimate goal of all  risk management activities is to achieve compliance with  internationally-accepted best practices.</p>
<p>For information about  internal audit, internal control, and risk management functions at Ziraat Bank, please see  pages 78-80 of the Bank&rsquo;s 2013 annual report.</p>

Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s efforts to  prevent money-laundering and the financing of terrorism are conducted in  accordance with policies that are publicly disclosed on the Bank&rsquo;s website and  also in compliance with the requirements of law. The&nbsp;Bank is committed to  preventing its products and services from being used to launder money and/or to  finance terrorism and it fulfills this commitment by ensuring that its  management and personnel comply fully and strictly with mandated standards.</p>
<p>The Audit Committee is  charged with the conduct of the compliance program formulated pursuant to  Regulations Concerning Compliance Programs For Obligations Pertaining To The  Prevention Of Money-Laundering And Terrorism-Financing and with the fulfillment  of statutorily mandated duties, authorities, and responsibilities related to  such issues.</p>
<p>Conducting all of its  operations within the framework of the &ldquo;Know Your Customer&rdquo; principle, Ziraat  Bank regards, as two fundamental objectives, both establishing the identities  of customers and of those acting on their behalf and ensuring that all required  records are maintained in full.</p>
<p><strong>Policies in effect at Ziraat Bank</strong><br />

<p><strong>Ziraat Bank Investor Relations Unit</strong><br />
The Ziraat Bank Investor  Relations Unit is responsible for managing relations with shareholders in the  event that a public offering takes place and also for satisfying the  transparency requirements mandated by laws and regulations. This unit is ready  to play an effective role in the protection and exercise of shareholder rights,  including but not limited to their right of access to information and their  right of inspection. Although Ziraat Bank has yet to undertake a public  offering, it has already committed itself to behaving as a company that has.</p>
<p>Located at <a href="../../../../tr.html" target="_blank">www.ziraatbank.com.tr</a>,  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate website plays an important role in keeping the public  informed with the most current news and information. Although Ziraat Bank is  not now a publicly-traded company, it already satisfies many of the  requirements of corporate governance principles.

Such documentation covers a broad range of issues from trade  registration details to the Bank&rsquo;s existing partnership and management  structure, from its articles of association to material event disclosures, and  from its financial statements to its annual reports.<strong> </strong></p>
