<p class="hilitegri"><strong>Role of Ziraat Bank’s in the Community</strong><br />
By providing employment opportunities to about 25,000 people, supporting the efforts of tens of millions of customers to transform their dreams into reality, and playing a key role in reducing the national savings gap, Ziraat Bank has been contributing beneficially to society since the day it was founded.
</p>

<p class="kirmizi">With a presence all over Turkey today and in its capacity as the only local financial services provider in some four hundred small towns, the contributions that Ziraat Bank makes to the community manifest themselves in many different ways. The Bank will continue to add value to the community and to take a multidimensional approach to supporting social development through activities capable of having a broad social impact.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting cultural  values</strong><br />
For a century and a half, Ziraat Bank has been consistently supporting  culture and the arts through a spirit of social collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the arts is a  Ziraat Bank tradition.</strong><br />
  The support that Ziraat Bank has been giving to art and artists  since the day it was founded is summed up in its slogan &ldquo;In Art For Art&rdquo;.  The&nbsp;Bank continues to take part in and support artistic activities in a  variety of ways.</p>
<p>In the 1990s Ziraat Bank began adding new links to the chain of  its support for the arts by opening its Mithatpaşa, Kuğulu, Tünel, and Kızıltan  Ulukavak art galleries and with the inauguration of the Ömer Nafi Güvenli  Exhibition Hall. The&nbsp;42 shows held at the Kuğulu and Mithatpaşa galleries  in Ankara and at the Tünel gallery in İstanbul were visited by more than 40  thousand people during the 2012-2013 season.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank sponsored the making of &ldquo;The Butterfly&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo;, a  feature-length movie released in 2013 that explores a socioculturally important  period of Turkey&rsquo;s history. </p>
<p><strong>Turkey&rsquo;s first museum  devoted to banking</strong><br />
  Located in the ceremonial hall of the Bank&rsquo;s original  headquarters building in the Ulus district of Ankara, the Ziraat Bank Museum  opened its doors to the public on 20&nbsp;November 1981. On display at this  museum, the first in Turkey to be devoted entirely to banking, are artifacts  representing the century and a half during which Ziraat Bank was a personal  witness to momentous events in every stage of the history of the Turkish  Republic.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Museum offers a panoramic view of the  commercial, economic, political, cultural, artistic, and educational  transformations that the Turkish banking industry has undergone since the  beginning down to the present day. On display for visitors to this historic  setting are a host of objects and materials highlighting the progress and  development of banking in Turkey.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank plans to relocate the banking museum currently  occupying the ceremonial hall of the Bank&rsquo;s former headquarters in Ulus to new  premises in the former Ankara Adakale nursery school, which is being redesigned  in line with the latest museological concepts and practices. With its planned  exhibition space of 710 m<sup>2</sup>, the new museum will make it possible to  show visitors a much bigger selection of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s rich art and artefact  collection.</p>
<p>Once the museum has been relocated, the Ulus building&rsquo;s  ceremonial hall will be refitted once again in keeping with its erstwhile  mission as it continues to bear witness to history.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancing value to  society: The Ziraat Bank Art Collection</strong><br />
Ever since its inception as Turkey&rsquo;s first nationally-owned bank  in the last quarter of the 19th century, Ziraat Bank has always  included cultivation of the arts as an item on its developmental agenda.</p>
<p>From the day it first opened its doors, Ziraat Bank has been  commissioning famous contemporary artists to produce sculptures and large-scale  paintings for addition to its collection. Indeed Ziraat Bank was the first  institution in Turkey to do so. Today the Bank&rsquo;s art collection is tremendously  important both for its intrinsic artistic value and as a panorama of the  history of Turkish painting and sculpture.</p>
<p>The works that make up the Ziraat Bank Collection begin with  examples from the early 19th century that bear the historical stamp  of Ottoman-period society while embracing its progressive development. They  continue with others that bear witness to the developmental changes that the  arts have gone through ever since, right down to the present day. Indeed some  of the works in the collection are the iconic hallmarks of the contemporary  arts of their time.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank Art Collection is a vast treasure-trove of works  ranging from Romantic landscapes to Impressionist and Symbolist  interpretations, from Expressionist approaches to Cubist explorations, from the  bold abstractions of the Paris School to Gestural and Geometrical Abstraction,  and from compositions rooted in traditional values and social realities to  avant-garde experimentation and the works of Modernist and Postmodern artists.</p>
<p>Beside serving as an exemplar of a conscientious art collector,  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s commitment to being a pioneer in society&rsquo;s cultural progress is  shown by the way in which it shares the works in its collection with the public  through the comprehensive exhibitions that it organizes and through a book that  documents the implications and results of informed, proper, sound, and  methodically- and systematically-supported collecting that is consistent with  artistic criteria.</p>
<p>The Ziraat Bank art collection consists of more than 2,500  works, the majority of which are oil paintings but which also include  watercolors, gouaches, pastels, prints, ceramics, and sculptures.  The&nbsp;collection continues to be enriched through acquisitions from among  works exhibited by artists at Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s galleries.</p>
<p>A project is currently  under way to restore a 19th-century building located in İstanbul&rsquo;s  Cağaloğlu district that is owned by the Bank. When completed, this venerable  structure will serve as the Ziraat Bank Museum of Painting and Sculpture, a  venue in which the Bank will continue to support culture and art by making the  precious works in its collection accessible to art lovers.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Ziraat Bank is the owner and conserving protector of cultural-heritage buildings located in Ankara and İstanbul as well as many other cities that are landmarks in the history of Turkish architecture.</p>
<p>There are fifty-two  listed and protected monuments belonging to the Bank that were erected after  1910 and are still in active use. Through maintenance and repair work that is  faithful to these buildings&rsquo; original architectural spirit, Ziraat Bank plays a  part in protecting the cultural heritage.</p>

<p><strong>Ziraat Turkish Cup: Supporting sport</strong><br />
Recognizing the mass  appeal of football in Turkey, Ziraat Bank has been the name sponsor of the  Turkish Cup for five years since the 2009/2010 season. Undertaken by the Bank  as a social responsibility project, this involvement in Turkish football is a  step forward for society to have a healthy future to the betterment of the  sport through such efforts as the &ldquo;Ziraat Turkish Cup Football Machine&rdquo;  advertisement that seeks to combat the mounting tide of stadium hooliganism by  promoting messages of good sportsmanship and amicability among fans.</p>
<p><strong>Two first prizes for &ldquo;Ziraat Turkish Cup Football Machine&rdquo;</strong><br />
  The &ldquo;Ziraat Turkish Cup  Football Machine&rdquo; TV spot received two accolades in the &ldquo;Sports Industry of the  Year&rdquo; series of awards in four categories and twelve branches. In&nbsp;an  awards ceremony conducted during the Turkish Sports Industry Summit, whose  theme was &ldquo;Sport In Brand Perception&rdquo; and which was hosted by Istanbul Commerce  University, the advertisement received awards in the &ldquo;Sports Communication Of  The Year&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sports Communication Message Of The Year&rdquo; categories.</p>
<p><strong>Support for scholarly publications</strong><br />
  Under the Yunus Emre  Institute&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 Turkish Libraries&rdquo; project, which was launched in 2012, Ziraat  Bank makes an important contribution to scholarly research by supporting the  establishment of one hundred Turkish libraries in different countries around  the world.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Kids On Vacation / School Under Repairs&rdquo;</strong><br />
  &ldquo;Kids On Vacation /  School Under Repairs&rdquo; is a social responsibility project through which schools  are being improved in government-designated &ldquo;Priority Developments Regions&rdquo;.  Under this project, Ziraat Bank makes an important contribution to the future  of the country by fixing up and fitting out its children&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank was a gold  sponsor of the First International Turkish Congress on Children and Media in  2013. On the occasion of this congress, a &ldquo;Declaration on Children and Media&rdquo;  was prepared and published.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Seyyah: Ulu Çınarın İzinde&rdquo; Project</strong><br />
First introduced in the  summer of 2012 with Ziraat Bank support to contribute to the personnel and  social development of economically deprived children and youths by taking them  on trips to interesting places around the country, the second season of the  program took place in 2013.</p>
<p>Through the &ldquo;Vocational  Education Project for Women&rdquo;, economically deprived girls and women are taught  vocational skills.</p>

<p><strong>E-learning for children</strong><br />
Owing to diminishing  natural resources, to economic hardships, and to environmental pollution and  the problems it creates, thrift confronts us as an issue of increasingly  greater importance.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank has prepared  a series of e-learning materials for children in order to make them aware of  thrift while also itself investing in the future of a world that can be at  peace with itself. These materials are accessible as interactive distance  learning modules on the Bank&rsquo;s website. Their aim is to help children  everywhere to learn, gain awareness, and improve themselves while having fun.</p>
<p>Dubbed &ldquo;Information  Islands&rdquo;, the series consists of individual learning modules called &ldquo;Money  &amp; Bank Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thrift Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;Borrowing &amp; Credit Card Island&rdquo;, and  &ldquo;Budget Island&rdquo;. As children play through these games, they learn about such  things as the relationship between money and banks, how banks function, online  and telephone banking, how to borrow and use credit cards wisely, and how to  make economical use of all resources from money to electricity and water.</p>
<p><strong>E-learning for farmers</strong><br />
  In keeping with its  mission to support agriculture, Ziraat Bank has prepared a series of e-learning  materials for use by farmers.</p>
<p>By educating farmers  about modern irrigation practices, the Bank introduces them to methods such as  drip irrigation that are more efficient and cause less environmental harm while  also informing them about which methods are suitable for which crops. This not  only helps farmers reduce their costs but also ensures that water resources are  used more effectively and that the environmental effects of uncontrolled and  excessive irrigation are prevented.</p>
<p>By educating farmers  about agricultural insurance and its importance, the Bank makes them aware of  ways to manage the risks that confront them and how to continue their  operations by ensuring that their losses are covered when such risks  materialize.</p>
<p><strong>Eco-awareness</strong><br />
  The &ldquo;Green Camera Short  Film Festival&rdquo; is organized by the Turkish Environmental Protection Foundation  in order to draw university students&rsquo; attention to environmental issues and to  inform the public at large about them. In&nbsp;keeping with its sense of social  responsibility, Ziraat Bank supports this festival as well as the foundation&rsquo;s  other activities and publications, including a magazine.</p>
