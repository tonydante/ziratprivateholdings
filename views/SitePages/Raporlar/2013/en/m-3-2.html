As in previous years, Ziraat Bank continued to open its doors to  young people seeking to pursue a career in banking in 2013. In&nbsp;its  recruitment announcements and examinations, the Bank allows candidates to  specify the province in which they would prefer to work. This practice arises  from Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s principle of recruiting locally. 92.6% of all newly-hired  personnel in 2013 were recruited from local sources. Under a new procedure  introduced in the Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> year, Ziraat Bank also began hiring  people with lycee and associate degree diplomas.</p>
    <p>An important tenet of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s HR policy is to employ  people in places where they prefer to work. In&nbsp;keeping with this, 57.5% of  employees&rsquo; requests for transfers were fulfilled in situations where staffing  conditions permitted.</p>
    <p>All Ziraat Bank personnel are employed under full-time,  indefinite-term work agreements. During 2013, a total of 3,125 employees  resigned from Ziraat Bank. The&nbsp;Bank&rsquo;s personnel turnover rate is 13% a  year.</p>

	<p><strong>Code of Ethics Pledge,  information disclosure</strong><br />
During the recruitment and hiring process, every employee is  required to sign the Bank&rsquo;s Code of Ethics Pledge. Information about job  descriptions and assignments and about performance and reward criteria is  disclosed clearly and transparently through the Ziraat Bank internet portal and  by email. These procedures are also monitored by appropriate headquarters units  for evidence of irregularities, abuse, and the like.</p>
    <p><strong>Individual Performance  Management System</strong><br />
      The Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management System is a  system whereby employees&rsquo; success and rankings are measured at regular  intervals on the basis of objectively quantifiable data, and in accordance with  predetermined parameters.</p>
    <p>Besides numerical benchmarks, the Individual Performance  Management System also considers competencies that are contingent upon an  individual&rsquo;s job position. Numerical-based performance measurement means assessing  performance by means of objective criteria that are associated with strategic  objectives. In&nbsp;Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s system, benchmarks pertaining to customer  focus, profitability, productivity, and risk management contribute  substantially to the numerical performance points an employee receives.</p>
    <p>The Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management System  encompassed all regional department and branch personnel in 2013. Work is  currently in progress to bring headquarters personnel into this system as well.</p>
    <p>In 2013 Ziraat Bank introduced a new bonus system which is  compatible with the Bank&rsquo;s new marketing- and sales-focused organizational  structure, which seeks to improve the effectiveness of sales staff, and which  is based on individual performance ratings. This new system was designed so as  to enable employees who demonstrate superior performance to earn more in  keeping with the principle that improvements in performance and effectiveness  should be rewarded and that compensation should increase with success.</p>
    <p>The performance bonus payments that are made on the basis of  periodically-conducted performance evaluations are intended to strengthen the  customer-focused business model, to foster marketing- and effectiveness-focused  work attitudes, to motivate employees and increase their loyalty to the  company, and to provide material rewards for individual success that is  compatible with corporate objectives.</p>
    <p>Under the Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management System,  a quarterly bonus budget is determined taking the Bank&rsquo;s profitability and  operational results into account and so as not to exceed 7% of total monthly  salary payments. The&nbsp;amount so allocated is paid to employees, along with  their February, May, August, and November salaries, as an individual performance  bonus that is determined according to objectively-defined, specific, and  numerically quantifiable criteria. In&nbsp;line with the Bank&rsquo;s strategies and  objectives, this system is marketing-oriented and bonuses are paid so as to  enable employees who contribute more on that front to earn more.</p>
    <p>The Ziraat Bank Individual Performance Management System was  designed to reward superior performance and essentially to increase the  productivity of sales personnel.</p>
    <p>All Ziraat Bank employees benefit from the Individual Performance  Management System.</p>
    <p><strong>Human Resources Career Management</strong><br />
    	As an employer, Ziraat Bank's approach to
career management is transparent. The Bank
additionally seeks to recruit and train its own
management personnel.</p>
    <p>A very important tenet of Ziraat Bank's
people-focused HR policy is that employees
should take satisfaction in the performance
of their jobs by serving in positions that
are compatible with their competencies.
To achieve this, in 2012 the Bank changed
over from a title-based, largely vertical
organizational structure to a more horizontal
structure based on job descriptions. With
this change, the concept of "job description"
was introduced in career management at
Ziraat Bank. In addition to a "title description"
that defines an employee's position in the
professional hierarchy, every employee
has also been assigned a "job description"
that sets out the particulars of his job, the
customers he comes into contact with, and
his marketing/operational functions.</p>
    <p>In the conduct of career-management
activities in 2013, 6,375 employees were
promoted to the next higher position based
on the results of their written and/or oral
exams.</p>
    <p>As of end-2013, a new job description setting
out his duties and authorities had been
written for every Ziraat Bank employee.</p>

	<p><strong>Personnel training in  2013</strong><br />
Personnel training activities conducted during 2013 are  summarized below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;First Step Training&rdquo; was provided to newly-recruited personnel  to help them become familiar with Ziraat Bank, adapt to its corporate culture,  and acquire basic and essential knowledge and skills.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Certification Training&rdquo; was provided to equip personnel in bank  officer and assistant positions with the knowledge, skills, and competencies  required by their positions.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Change Management Training Programs&rdquo; were conducted to support  the development of such managerial skills as supporting change, understanding  employees during periods of change, becoming a part of bank strategies,  correctly using motivational tools, and resolving conflicts.</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Professional Training&rdquo; was provided to employees in line with  the Bank&rsquo;s objectives and strategies in order to familiarize them with new  products, services, and changes in laws and regulations.</li>
      <li>All training mandated by laws and regulations was duly provided  to personnel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During 2013, a total of 21,278 employees (corresponding to  159,518 individual trainees*) were provided with training at Ziraat  Bank. These figures do not include e-training. Average training time per  employee was 51.84 hours.</p>
    <p>Owing to the extensive nature of its service network, Ziraat  Bank also makes considerable use of e-training in the conduct of its personnel  training activities. E-training makes it possible to provide training to more  employees in less time and without causing lost worktime. Employees can take  part in e-training wherever and whenever it is convenient for them and they can  proceed at their own pace. E-training is used to support classroom training. By  reducing the need for employees to travel to training sites, e-training also  makes an indirect contribution to environmental wellbeing. A total of 216,030  trainee individuals took part in e-training programs during 2013.</p>
    <p>In 2013, a total of 20,338 employees were provided with training  on 262 subjects intended to improve their financial literacy.</p>

    <p class="dipnot">*  Individual trainee: This term is used in the Bank&rsquo;s training statistics. If one  employee takes part in three different training programs during a year, he  counts as three &ldquo;individual trainees&rdquo; even though he is only one person.</p>
    <p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s approach to  personnel remuneration</strong><br />
Along with the changeover from a title- to a job-description  structure, a new remuneration system was also introduced at the beginning of  2013. Some aspects of the system were revised and some additions were made in  light of needs during the year. At the beginning of 2014, employees will also  start receiving a supplementary payment in addition to their normal salary to  compensate them for the time they must spend in their current position that  exceeds the normal period that must pass before they are entitled to be  promoted.</p>
    <p>For details about the relationship between remuneration and  performance at Ziraat Bank, please refer to the Individual Performance  Management System on page 49 of this report.</p>
    <p><span class="kirmizi">Remuneration Committee</span><br />
    The Remuneration Committee is responsible for supervising and  auditing remuneration practices on behalf of the Board of Directors at Ziraat  Bank. This committee reviews remuneration policies and practices within the  framework of risk management in order to ensure their compliance with the Bank&rsquo;s  ethical values and strategic objectives and it makes recommendations  accordingly to the Board of Directors at regular intervals.</p>
    <p><strong>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s approach to  senior management remuneration</strong><br />
    All remuneration that is to be paid to members of the Bank&rsquo;s  Board of Directors and to its general manager is decided upon at annual general  meetings. The&nbsp;Treasury Undersecretariat&rsquo;s representative is authorized to  advance motions concerning such payments.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare and other  fringe benefits</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank employees who are not civil servants as well as  their family members also benefit from healthcare services provided by the  Social Security Institution. Subject to certain principles and procedures, they  may also receive additional payments for medical treatment from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s budget within the framework of authorities granted  by the Bank&rsquo;s Board of Directors</li>
  <li>The budget of the Health Assistance Fund in the case of personal  who are members of that fund and within the framework of authorities granted by  the fund&rsquo;s own administration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ziraat Bank also enters into agreements with private hospitals,  clinics, medical imaging centers, doctors&rsquo; surgeries, and similar healthcare  providers under which its employees have access to their medical services. Such  matters are announced via the Bank&rsquo;s internet portal.</p>
<p><strong>Occupational health &amp;  safety at Ziraat Bank</strong><br />
  Occupational health &amp; safety units have been set up at  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s Ankara and İstanbul headquarters as required by the Occupational  Health &amp; Safety Act. Workplace physicians are on duty at these units.</p>
<p>Occupational health &amp; safety training was also provided to  3,752 people at Ziraat Bank in 2013.</p>
<p>During 2013, no worktime was lost at the Bank for such reasons  as injuries, occupational diseases, strikes, lockouts, natural disasters, or  structural collapse. Similarly there were no fatal job-related accidents at the  Bank last year.</p>
<p><strong>A proactive approach in  private pensions</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank engages in a synergetic collaboration with Ziraat  Hayat ve Emeklilik, a life insurer and private pension provider, in order to  help its employees augment their pension savings and enjoy a more comfortable  retirement by taking advantage of the benefits afforded by the national Private  Pension System (PPS).</p>
<p>Under the &ldquo;Biz Bize&rdquo; Group Pension Plan, bank employees and  their relatives are not charged PPS policy entrance fees, do not have to pay  management fees, and pay a specially-discounted fund operations fee.</p>
<p>An employer-sponsored group pension plan for Ziraat Bank  personnel was launched on 1&nbsp;January 2013. In&nbsp;this plan, the Bank  contributes up to 3% of an employee&rsquo;s gross monthly salary (or at least  TRY&nbsp;50) a month to the group pension-plan account that the employee opens  with Ziraat Hayat ve Emeklilik and to which he contracts to contribute up to 3%  of his gross monthly salary (or at least TRY&nbsp;50) a month. Under this scheme,  which is intended to help employees build up their retirement savings more  quickly, employees also receive an additional state contribution corresponding  to 25% of the amount that they pay into their pension account.</p>
<p>In order to increase employees&rsquo; motivation and company loyalty  and also to encourage them to save up for retirement, Ziraat Bank will begin  paying an employer&rsquo;s pension contribution of TRY&nbsp;50 a month to every  employee as of 1&nbsp;January 2014 whether or not the employee pays a  contribution of his own. In&nbsp;this way, even employees who have never paid a  pension contribution of their own will be brought into the PPS through the  employer group pension contracts that are created. Employees who have not  previously paid a pension contribution and who are covered by these new  employer group pension contracts will also be able to take advantage of the  additional employer contribution rule if they opt to start making their own  contributions.</p>
<p class="hilitegri">Seeking to ensure the sustainability of a participatory and collaborative workplace environment, Ziraat Bank gives great importance to employee communication.</p>
	<p><strong>Improvements in working  conditions</strong><br />
System development projects are being carried out to reduce the  amounts of overtime that must be worked at Ziraat Bank.</p>
    <p>The Bank&rsquo;s branches are being renovated both to improve  employees&rsquo; working conditions and to create more modern and spacious settings  in which to provide customers with financial consultancy services. In&nbsp;this  context, branches are being completely redesigned taking Ziraat Customer  Business Model principles and concepts into account; four hundred branches  underwent such renovation in 2013.</p>
    <p><strong>Employee communication</strong><br />
      Seeking to ensure the sustainability of a participatory and  collaborative workplace environment, Ziraat Bank gives great importance to  employee communication. Information about the ways it does this is given below.</p>
    <p><strong>Ziraat Bank Employee Suggestion System:</strong> Ziraat Bank has always  supported innovation and it regards employees&rsquo; suggestions and feedback as  input for its ongoing development. The&nbsp;Ziraat Bank Employee Suggestion  System was set up to give the Bank the benefit of employees&rsquo; knowledge and  experience, to encourage employees to think critically, and to continuously  improve service efficiency and quality. In&nbsp;2013 work began on creating a  more user-friendly suggestion system to replace the existing one. Designed to  be more actively used by employees and to ensure that suggestions reach and are  assessed by those concerned more quickly, this new system is scheduled to  become operational in the first quarter of 2014.</p>
    <p><strong>Communication Meetings:</strong> When laying out its strategic roadmaps, Ziraat Bank solicits and  makes use of its employees&rsquo; experience, opinions, and suggestions. This was  done in the following ways during the reporting period.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First Step Meetings:</strong> These are meetings at which the Ziraat Bank general manager  explains the Bank&rsquo;s strategies and goals to all employees. At these meetings,  employees may pose questions that the general manager himself answers  personally. Thirty-two such meetings were held in 21 cities last year.</li>
      <li><strong>Information Meetings: </strong>Held at approximately three-month intervals, these are meetings  that are attended by the senior managers of the Bank&rsquo;s domestic and  international branches and subsidiaries and at which they are informed about  all impending new developments. At the end of the presentation, a  question-and-answer session is conducted so that current issues may be  discussed interactively. Fifty-two of these meetings were held last year.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Meetings:</strong> These are quarterly meetings led by Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s general  manager at which target performances are discussed and process-related issues  are debated.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus Group Meetings:</strong> Focus group meetings are attended by branch personnel and by  headquarters and regional department senior executives. Such meetings provide  valuable opportunities to air employees&rsquo; views and suggestions about changes in  branch business processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Weekly Bulletins:</strong> Innovations and changes taking place at Ziraat Bank are  announced to all employees through weekly bulletins. The&nbsp;first such  bulletin appeared in March 2012; as of end-2013, 76 issues had been published. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Marking the Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup>  anniversary, 2013 was an especially important year at Ziraat Bank.</strong></p>
    <p><span class="kirmizi">Ziraat Bank employees get  together at 150<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Staff Gatherings.</span><br />

Speaking at  these gatherings, bank executives thanked the attending guests for their  dedicated efforts during the conduct of their careers while also noting that it  is employees who are the most responsible for Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s having been &ldquo;More  than a bank&rdquo; for a century and a half.	</p>

	<p><span class="kirmizi">150<sup>th</sup>  Anniversary Reception</span><br />
Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s 150<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Reception was held in  Ankara on 27&nbsp;November 2013. The&nbsp;event, which was attended by Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s senior management and three thousand distinguished guests, was also  honored by the presence of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ERDOĞAN and Deputy Prime  Minister Ali BABACAN.</p>
    <p>The reception was held at the Ankara Congresium congress center,  whose exterior and foyer served as the backdrop for visual effects and one of  the biggest video-mapping displays ever performed in Turkey. Guests arriving at  the reception entered the main hall by passing through an image of Ziraat  Bank&rsquo;s original headquarters in Ankara&rsquo;s historical Ulus district projected on  the exterior. Once inside, guests were treated to a stunning visual experience  in the form of a video display highlighting the changes, the growth and  development, and the achievements of Ziraat Bank since the day it was founded.  All images were projected in high-resolution through an indoor mapping system  that perfectly matched the dimensions of the interior.</p>
    <p>A special exhibition of a selection of 150 works from the Ziraat  Bank Art Collection was also held concurrently with the 150<sup>th</sup>  Anniversary Reception.</p>
