</div>



<div class="dartext">
	<p class="hilite">For the last two decades, the relationship between the environment and economic development has been one of the world’s most hotly-debated subjects. Even as the United Nations and a host of international initiatives engage in efforts to protect the environment and to combat climate change and such issues are debated at multilateral conferences, progress is slowed by claims that protecting the environment means sacrificing economic growth and development.</p>
	<p><strong>An essential duty incumbent on world-leading companies like Ziraat Bank is to behave like an exemplary corporate citizen by spearheading environment-related initiatives and authoring best practices for dealing with such issues. Such a role makes it necessary not only to control and minimize its own direct environmental impact but also the indirect environmental impact caused by its products and services and throughout our the value-creation chain. At the same time, Ziraat Bank regards protecting the environment and combating climate change as avenues leading to the creation of new business opportunities and to the possibility of generating added value on a variety of fronts ranging from employment to reducing the national current account deficit.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Since the early 2000s, Ziraat Bank has been involved in projects seeking to optimize its use of resources such as energy, water, natural gas, and paper in its business processes, to conserve them, and to eliminate waste. Under the Sustainability Policy that it announced in 2014, the Bank has embarked upon a process of creating a new and systematic structure for its efforts to manage direct environmental impact.</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The prime environmental objective identified in the Ziraat Bank  Sustainability Policy is, in the Bank&rsquo;s capacity as one of the biggest  employers with the most extensive physical reach in the Turkish banking  industry, to limit its direct and indirect environmental impact and to manage  and continuously improve environmental performance through proper strategies  and technologies.</li>
        <li>Ziraat Bank has measured its carbon footprint for the first time  in 2013. Having done so, Ziraat Bank intends to continue its efforts to reduce  the greenhouse gas emissions generated by service processes. The&nbsp;new  Ziraat Bank headquarters, a LEED-certified green and intelligent building  planned for construction in the İstanbul Financial Center, will become  recognized as a sectoral best practice.</li>
        <li>The Bank will continue, without letup, its efforts to manage all  of the physical elements of Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s service network (buildings, IT  infrastructure, etc.) in keeping with the principle of making efficient use of  all natural resources, including energy.</li>
        <li>In addition to fully complying with legally mandated  environmental standards in Turkey, champion the spread of globally-accepted  best practices and standards on such matters and continue efforts in this  direction by engaging in a multilateral dialogue with stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Value and encourage efforts by Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s customers and  suppliers to increase environmental awareness and to involve themselves in  other endeavors that will add value to environmental sustainability.	</li>

	<p><strong>Paper use and optimization projects</strong><br />
Paper ranks high among  the most frequently-used supplies at Ziraat Bank owing to its role as a  financial services provider.</p>
    <p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s paper  procurements amounted to 2,084 tons in 2013. In&nbsp;order to reduce its paper  consumption, Ziraat Bank adheres to an approach that focuses on taking  advantage of electronic media wherever possible when processing, transmitting,  viewing, and retaining (archiving) documents. Thanks to such efforts and  practices, an average of 25 million sheets of A4 paper are being conserved  every year.</p>
    <p>Brief information about  projects to decrease paper use at Ziraat Bank and to enhance the effectiveness  of paper that is used is presented below.</p>
<p class="hilitegri">Under the Sustainability Policy that it announced in 2014, the Bank has embarked upon a process of creating a new and systematic structure for its efforts to manage direct environmental impact.</p>
	<p><strong>Electronic-format appraisal reports</strong><br />
Since November 2011, all  appraisal reports generated at Ziraat Bank have been requested, disseminated,  and archived electronically.</p>
    <p>Thanks to this new  system, bank employees&rsquo; non-banking operational workloads and risks have been  reduced and operational standards have been improved. Once issued by the  system, electronic-format appraisal reports can also be stored and displayed  from within the system without having to undergo any other archiving process.  This system also prevents the generation of unnecessary printouts.</p>
    <p><strong>E-mailed customer transaction advice notes and statements</strong><br />
      In 2013, Ziraat Bank  began sending statements of all transactions performed by its Operations Center  to customers by email.</p>
    <p>Under the Centralized  Bulk Statement Dispatch Project, transaction notes and statements for  transactions which must be so reported as well as for those which requests are  made are sent to customers by email.</p>
    <p><strong>Bulk bill payments</strong><br />
      Work has begun on a  project to send out electronic-format rather than paper invoices documenting  communication services. Since June 2013, all telephony-related invoices are  being processed through the electronic system. Considering that more than  163,000 telephone bills were handled last year alone, the savings in paper  resulting from this procedure may be appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Loan account documentation</strong><br />
Work is in progress on a  project to create virtual loan-account files to replace the physical ones that  are used for loan applications. All application-related documents will be  scanned into the system after which it will be possible for all  involved/authorized units to display them. This project will contribute  significantly towards paper-reduction efforts.</p>
<p>In the case of documents  that the law requires be obtained from other agencies and organizations when  making credit allocation decisions, efforts are currently being made to obtain  these from their sources in electronic format as well. That will help such  outside concerns in their own efforts to reduce paper use; for the Bank, it  will increase employee motivation and customer satisfaction by speeding up  processing.</p>
<p>In January 2013, the  Bank began obtaining electronic-format documents and information required of  firms taking out loans to finance investments. This also saves paper, labor,  time, and space. Documentation used in performing firms&rsquo; financial analyses is  also being circulated among units in electronic format.<br />
  The practice of sending  out documents concerning loan applications approved by Ziraat Bank by mail or  fax has been terminated. These documents are now being transmitted in  electronic format along with the original application appended to them. A  centralized collection system encompassing all Ziraat Bank branches became  operational on 12&nbsp;March 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic-format inspection and internal control reporting</strong><br />
  Under a new auditing and  control model that is about to be put into effect, all inspection and internal  control reports will be issued in electronic format and physical documents will  no longer be circulated. This project is expected to contribute significantly  to paper conservation.</p>
<p><strong>E-signature &amp; Virtual Inspection Archives Project</strong><br />
  With the E-signature  &amp; Virtual Inspection Archives Project, the Bank will take another step in  the direction of a paperless office environment by replacing all &ldquo;wet&rdquo;  signatures with electronic ones. Under this project, electronic-format  inspection reports and all Board of Inspectors documentation will be stored  digitally in the Virtual Inspection Archives. Eventually, digitized reports  with e-signatures will also be sent in external correspondence with official  agencies.</p>

<div class="dartext">
	<p><strong>Other paper conservation activities</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paper has been eliminated in all in-house correspondence since  19&nbsp;September 2012. Such correspondence is now being sent via the Bank&rsquo;s  internal correspondence system.</li>
      <li>Work is continuing on projects in all branch, regional, and headquarters  units to send and receive faxes in electronic format and eliminating printouts.</li>
      <li>In March 2013, Ziraat Bank introduced a policy requiring  double-side printing wherever possible. Users are directed to take double-sided  printouts if they can and single-sided ones only if they must.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Ziraat Bank seeks to optimize the use of environmentally-harmful  office supplies and materials.</strong><br />
      When procuring office  equipment such as printers and fax machines that require expendable supplies  such as toner and drums, the Bank gives attention to the total cost of  ownership, which is defined as acquisition cost plus the cost of a unit&rsquo;s  operating supplies over a five-year period. In&nbsp;this way, the Bank takes  the potential environmental impact of supplies into account and purchasing  decisions are made on that basis rather than on low initial cost. Preference is  also given to equipment that requires less in the way of expendables over the  course of its useful lifetime. By doing so, the Bank helps reduce the adverse  environmental impact arising both from the supplies&rsquo; production and from their  disposal as waste.</p>
<p>In the tendering for  multifunction printers to be procured in 2013, one of the criteria was &ldquo;use  less toner&rdquo;. In&nbsp;keeping with this, toner-saving software was procured to  reduce toner consumption and costs. This program makes it possible to adjust  the amounts of toner used by a machine according to different needs. According  to the various scenarios in the feasibility study prepared for the program, the  software reduces Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s toner expenditures by between  USD&nbsp;100,000-200,000 a year.</p>
<p>In addition, a pixel  optimization solution was purchased that achieves about a 25% saving in the  amount of toner used in all printouts taken at the Bank. By lowering toner  emissions, the amounts of potentially carcinogenic materials released into the  environment is also reduced. Centralized toner management also reduces stock  costs by automatically dispatching toner supplies to branches and units only  when the currently available stock level has fallen to 20%.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank intends to  enter into agreements with environment ministry-licensed firms authorized to  safely collect and dispose of spent toner cartridges. This procedure is  expected to begin in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Waste management</strong></p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Waste paper</span><br />
Since 2003, Ziraat Bank  has been collecting its waste paper as well as paper documents whose retention  by the Bank&rsquo;s units is no longer mandated by law and selling it to licensed  firms for use in recycling. In&nbsp;this way, the Bank helps reduce the amounts  of new raw materials needed in paper manufacturing while also contributing  beneficially to the consumption of production factors. A total of 139 tons of  waste paper generated by headquarters units was sold in this way during 2013.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">IT and other scrap</span><br />
  Ziraat Bank sells  discarded IT equipment (computers, printers, photocopiers, etc.), consisting  largely of sheet metal (housings, storage batteries, and ATM units) to  environment ministry-licensed firms authorized to transport and process such  scrap. This prevents the scrap from causing environmental harm while also  ensuring that it is recycled for use as inputs by others.</p>
<p> <span class="kirmizi">Fire extinguishers</span><br />
  When replacing the  chemicals in fire extinguishers that have passed their expiration date, Ziraat  Bank works with firms licensed to collect and dispose of such materials. By  working only with duly supervised and authorized firms, the Bank ensures that  the chemicals are properly eliminated without causing environmental damage.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring and reducing the environmental impact of construction  projects</strong><br />
In the conduct of its  own construction works, Ziraat Bank takes an R&amp;D approach when considering  the functionality of their plumbing, electrical components, fittings,  furniture, furnishings and similar inputs and such aspects as regional and  local suitability and recyclability. The&nbsp;Bank gives precedence to concepts  whose environmental impact is potentially the least.</p>
<p>Making sustainability  concepts intrinsic to architectural and engineering projects and identifying  the results of such efforts takes time and correctly quantifying all their  ramifications is possible only through long-term objective research.</p>
<p>During 2013,  construction work was completed on 360 branch projects in which due attention  was given to sustainability concepts. In&nbsp;the project design and  application stages, precedence was given to the use of innovative, composite  materials that transcended classical criteria and whose environmental impact  was considered as well.</p>
<p>When structures are to  be demolished, attention is given as early as the project-costing stage to the  recovery and reuse of materials. Particular care is given to recycling natural  materials. During 2013, about twenty of the Bank&rsquo;s service buildings underwent  controlled demolition and their materials were recovered.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the  environmental impact of Ziraat Bank construction projects, waste generated  during the conduct of work is transferred under supervision to locations  designated by local municipal authorities. In&nbsp;all such projects, efforts  are made to contribute beneficially to the environment through effective  supervision that ensures that waste is properly removed from building sites.</p>

	<p><strong>Enhancing value to the environment: Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s new  LEED-certified headquarters project</strong><br />
Ziraat Bank intends to  obtain LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for  the Ziraat Towers project that it is having built at the International  Financial Center Complex in İstanbul&rsquo;s Ataşehir district. LEED is a &ldquo;green  building&rdquo; ratings program and such certification is given only to accepted  world-class best practices in building design, construction, operation, and  maintenance. Among the features of the new Ziraat Bank headquarters that will  qualify it for LEED certification, mention may be made of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bicycle parking spaces are provided to encourage alternative  modes of transportation.</li>
      <li>More than 20% of the grounds are devoted to green space.</li>
      <li>Rainwater runoff is managed economically.</li>
      <li>High-efficiency fixtures are used.</li>
      <li>Low-emission materials are used.</li>
      <li>Daylight use is maximized.</li>
      <li>Waste water is recycled with 100% efficiency.</li>
      <li>Mains water is utilized with 100% efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
	<p class="title2">Initiatives to reduce energy use</p>
	<p><strong>Ziraat Bank is focused on having a sustainable IT infrastructure  that uses energy efficiently.</strong><br />
When tendering its  computer, multifunction printer, and similar IT procurements, Ziraat Bank makes  energy use one of the criteria of its total cost of their ownership  calculations. The&nbsp;Bank seeks to reduce the operating costs of such  equipment over the course of its useful lifetime by procuring units that use  less energy. Besides reducing the load that these units impose on the national  energy grid, this approach incidentally leads to water resource conservation because  22% of the country&rsquo;s electricity is generated by hydroelectric power plants.</p>
    <p>In all IT hardware  procurements, energy consumption is treated as an important parameter that  informs the contract award decision. Total cost of ownership is calculated taking  into account the amount of energy that a unit will use over a five-year period.  This rule supports the procurement of energy-efficient IT hardware.<br />
      When hardware is to be  procured, Ziraat Teknoloji, a bank-owned technology subsidiary, takes part in  the preparation of technical specifications and also subjects equipment to  performance tests that include electrical-efficiency measurement. Electrical  efficiency is one of the specific criteria to which points are assigned during  the testing process and preference is given to goods that earn suitable  utilization ratings.</p>
    <p>Instead of purchasing  separate printers, photocopiers, scanners, and fax machines, preference is  given to equipment that saves energy by combining all four functions in a  single unit. This practice results in energy savings of up to two-thirds.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">E-signatures in tenders</span><br />
Ziraat Bank has begun  using e-signatures in its tendering processes in order to save on time as well  as on the fuel and paper that would otherwise be used by/for personnel and travel.  This helps eliminate the environmental harm caused by the use of expendables in  the conduct of procedures and it also permits labor and time to be used for  other purposes.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Less travel through  videoconferencing</span><br />
  Ziraat Bank possesses a  huge service network that reaches every part of Turkey. Videoconferencing is  used for meetings in which the Bank&rsquo;s headquarters units and other units  scattered all over the country must take part. This method helps reduce the  incidental environmental impact caused by the Bank&rsquo;s travel and transport  activities.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Synergies between  branches in different localities</span><br />
  Information and  operations related to customers&rsquo; projects in different cities are handled with  the support (including technical personnel) of the regional/branch units  involved. This saves on fuel, time, and labor costs.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Centralized audit</span><br />
  Potentially risk-fraught  transactions are identified by means of a variety of scenarios deployed every  month by the Ziraat Bank centralized audit team. This allows necessary checks  to be made through the system without any physical documentation being  required. This practice saves not only paper but also time, expense, and  energy.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Fuel-consumption criteria  in vehicle procurements</span><br />
  When procuring vehicles,  Ziraat Bank gives as much attention to fuel consumption as it does to other  criteria. The&nbsp;fuel that vehicles being considered for purchase require is  treated as an element of total cost of ownership while fuel economy is included  as one of the criteria of tendering specifications. Besides lowering the  vehicles&rsquo; environmental impact, this practice also incidentally reduces total  fossil fuel consumption at the national level.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Changeover to LED  illumination</span><br />
Seeking to conserve  energy wherever possible, Ziraat Bank is reducing its illumination costs by  installing more energy-efficient LED lighting systems in its branches, signage,  and ATM housings. The&nbsp;Bank is also minimizing its use of fluorescent  lighting owing to the human and environmental health and safety issues that it  poses.</p>
<p> <span class="kirmizi">Efficiency in  architectural design</span><br />
  When designing  architectural projects, resource utilization is improved through the use of  natural daylight, potentially eco-harmful materials are avoided, and precedence  is given to applications that will quickly pay for themselves in two years or  so.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Changeover to a new WAN  structure</span><br />
  A project, launched  about a year ago to change all branch data lines to a new WAN (wide area  network) structure, is slated for completion by the end of March 2014. Under  this project, transfer speeds will be increased and cabling will also be  simplified without the need for new hardware.</p>
<p>Ziraat Bank owns and  operates an extensive ATM system. Studies looking into the feasibility of  installing biometric systems on ATM units and their housings are currently in  progress. With the completion of this project, it will also be possible to  centrally monitor local ambient temperatures and energy use. By collecting and  analyzing such data, energy use can be reduced by making fine-tuned  adjustments.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Centralized branch  inspections</span><br />
  Along with the  introduction of the New Auditing Model at Ziraat Bank, the Centralized  Inspection Project will also become operational, thereby making it possible to  perform branch inspections directly from headquarters. Under this project, bank  inspectors will carry out their inspections remotely without having to actually  visit a branch&rsquo;s physical premises. This project is expected to achieve  significant savings in terms of time, cost, and energy.</p>
<p><span class="kirmizi">Identifying risky  transactions by the Inspection Scenario Team</span><br />
Scenarios have been  composed for use by the Inspection Scenario Team to identify transactions that  are incompatible with Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s corporate risk attitudes. These scenarios  will enable the team&rsquo;s members to spot potential risks among thousands of  transactions and enable bank inspectors to focus their attentions on those.  This project is intended to achieve significant savings in terms of time, cost,  and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing value to the environment: Ziraat Bank Data Centers  Project</strong><br />
  Ziraat Bank is  restructuring its data centers in light of its current needs. The&nbsp;Ziraat  Bank Data Centers Project has a twofold IT focus that concentrates separately  on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The organizations to which services are provided (Ziraat Bank  units, other banks, insurance companies, pension companies, etc.)</li>
  <li>The diversity of the services being provided (online banking,  ATM network access, credit cards, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the design,  construction, installation, and relocation of data centers, attention is to be  given to the interactions among all of these services.</p>
<p>The gains to be secured  through this project may be summed up as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Risk management functions will be improved by the changeover to  a technological structure that is newer and more secure.</li>
  <li>A higher level of performance will be achieved.</li>
  <li>Less energy will be consumed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="dartext">
	<p><strong>As things currently stand, Ziraat Bank consumes 6,570,000 kWh of  electricity every year. With the renovation of the Ziraat Bank Data Centers, it  is anticipated that this will fall to about the 4,226,700 kWh level,  corresponding in other words to savings of about 2,343,300 kWh a year.</strong></p>
    <p><span class="kirmizi">IT power utilization</span><br />
    In 2005 Ziraat Bank  initiated a Green IT project with the aim of optimizing the energy use of the  computers used in its branch, regional, and headquarters units.</p>
    <p>Under a policy  introduced in 2013, users are messaged notices advising them to shut down their  computers. These warnings are sent out at 19:30, 21:30, and 23:30. Units will  automatically shut down unless the user takes action within 60 seconds of the  notification. When computers at Ziraat Bank remain idle for 10 minutes, their  monitors automatically go into sleep mode in order to help conserve energy.</p>
<p><strong>Other environmental-impact mitigation activities</strong><br />
In 2013 Ziraat Bank  procured 1,724 split air conditioners equipped with high energy-efficiency  inverter technology and non-ozone-depleting gas. Of these units, 212 that the  Bank procured to help reduce its heating costs, comply with the Variable  Refrigerant Flow/Volume (VRF/VRV) standard.</p>
<p>The specifications for  Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s procurements of cleaning materials used by its branches and units  stipulate that they must be manufactured from chemicals that are not harmful to  either human or environmental health. The&nbsp;cleaning equipment (vacuum cleaners,  mops, floor polishers, etc.) and the cleaning supplies (detergents, soaps,  polishes, disinfectants, etc.) used to clean service buildings are procured by  outside cleaning service providers however their compliance with specifications  are periodically checked by the Bank.</p>
<p>In line with its efforts  to reduce the environmental impact of its personnel transportation services,  Ziraat Bank has begun using routing software that shortens travel distances and  thus saves fuel. This project, which seeks both to maximize service quality and  to minimize cost, is slated for completion by the end of 2014.</p>
<p class="kirmizi">Ziraat Bank focuses on efficiently managing its indirect environmental impact.</p>
	<p>Ziraat Bank&rsquo;s indirect  environmental impact manifests itself in its product and service presentation  processes.</p>
    <p>Ziraat Bank supplies  financial support to businesses that play a key role in combating environmental  degradation and climate change, especially in the areas of renewable energy and  energy efficiency. The&nbsp;Bank also collaborates with international financial  institutions on such issues.</p>
    <p>More detailed  information about the Bank&rsquo;s activities under this heading during the reporting  period is given in the &ldquo;Our Customers&rdquo; section beginning on page 33 of this  report.</p>
<p><strong>Effective indirect environmental impact management through  sectoral specialization</strong><br />
In parallel with its  general strategies and sustainability policy, Ziraat Bank seeks to more  effectively manage the indirect impact that its products and services have on  the environment and on climate change through a new organizational structure  that focuses on sectoral specialization. The&nbsp;Bank is currently in the  process of creating units that will specialize in manufacturing, construction,  agriculture, and energy project investments. This will make it possible for the  Bank to keep a much closer watch on sector-specific issues such as technology,  changes in the legal framework, and investment tax incentives and thus to  propose potent value-creation solutions to its customers.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>In the area of renewable  energy and energy efficiency investments, which have become increasingly more  important in Turkey and throughout the world especially in recent years,  projects are being carried out that will increase both the Bank&rsquo;s knowledge  about such matters and its capacity to be involved in them by obtaining support  from consultancies and through in-house activities in order to deal with  Turkey&rsquo;s growing energy needs and to encourage interest in renewable energy  projects.</p>
<div class="grikutu">
