					<p class="arabaslik"> Ziraat's "Transformation" Continues </p>
					<p>The transformation we initiated in 2012 to take Ziraat Bank's successful performance forward into the future continues apace under the slogan "Together, to a Better Future." This effort enjoys the strong support of all stakeholders–from employees to customers–by means of infrastructural change and corporate development projects. In this process, which is of crucial importance for Our Bank's sustainability approach, we are constructing a strong enterprise architecture that will meet customers' financial needs through the right channel, at the right time and via the right value proposition, in line with the latest advances in information technology. </p>
					<p class="arabaslik">Ziraat Bank's Core Business Lines</p>
					<p>Focusing on Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and International Banking in 2015, Ziraat Bank implemented a number of sustainability projects during the year in a wide range of areas. These included agricultural support loans, SME support packages, intermediation in the state's social assistance payments, and the financing of renewable energy projects. Ziraat Bank undertook these efforts without compromising its principles of maintaining a strong balance sheet and adhering to operational excellence. </p>
					<p class="arabaslik">Successful Performance Crowned with Awards </p>
					<p>Ziraat Bank's strong financial and operational performance was not only valued by various groups of stakeholders, but also deemed worthy of numerous prestigious awards in both international and national platforms. The Banker, a prominent publication of the financial community, designated Ziraat Bank as "Western Europe's 2nd Most Robust Bank," based on criteria such as capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, risk environment and profitability. As a result of the "Survey on Differentiation Elements in the Banking Industry" carried out by Akademetre Research, Ziraat Bank was named as the "Most Reliable Bank in Turkey that Makes the Highest Contribution to the National Economy," further bolstering its robust brand image. </p>
